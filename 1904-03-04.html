                              We ask our subscribers who paid for the “Genuine Jew” when it was published only once
                              a week, to please send money to add to their subscription according to the current
                              price of the newspaper. For those who do not 
                              remargin, we will deduct the difference from their current subscription. This means
                              those who subscribed for half a year will receive the paper for only four months.
                              The same applies to yearly and quarterly subscribers.

                              It is sad to recount, our hearts hurt and we want to cry when we look around all the
                              corners of Jewish life in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span>. We do not find one thing we are happy about. 
                              No matter where we look, there is neglect, dereliction, and chaos - it is shocking!
                              </p>

                              The “talmetoyre” belongs to this sad chapter of our life. Talme-Toyre is the greatest
                              commandment for us Jews, “The study of Torah is equivalent to all other commandments
                              combined.” our scholars, <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2902413" target="_blank">may their memory be a blessing</a>
                              Our talme-toyre are <em>more than anything else, heavily neglected</em>. The more important a commandment is, the bigger we neglect them. The bigger the
                              benefit, the less it is badly administered.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              We do not need to tell you how important the Talme-Toyre is, every Jew understands
                              that on their own. We are not only referring to learning the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q930585" target="_blank">Gemara</a> and <a href="place" target="_blank">Pirush Hamishnayot</a> 
                              - we are also referring to simply learning the (Hebrew) alphabet, to the reading of
                              Hebrew, about the Torah, how to pray, to understand the meaning of all of that. All
                              the things we cannot imagine a child not knowing about without being very sad, dark,
                              and bitter. 
                              The number of children not knowing how to read and write, not knowing the alphabet,
                              who do not know the prayers and lore in the Torah is increasing. The children of rich
                              parents who can afford a tutor, do not suffer as badly, they are still learning something.
                              
                              However, the children of the lower class, the children of which our scholars, may
                              their memory be a blessing, have said: “Beware of the poor, for from them Torah will
                              come.” These children are neglected completely. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>  
                              Those who visit school, do not know about the Torah at all. They are being taught
                              religion at school, but do not ask how. However, those children who do not visit a
                              school, do not have a great knowledge. Their parents cannot 
                              afford a tutor and without money, they cannot learn a lot.

                           <p>
                              It has always been like that poor parents were not able to provide an education. That
                              is why every community founded a talmetoyre where a teacher taught and poor children
                              could learn for free. Nowadays there is a talmetoyre in 
                              every community - but in what condition? What do children learn there? What can they
                              do when they finish it? These questions could anyone who has experienced these conditions
                              themselves answer. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>   
                              The sad part is that every community agrees on the commandment, a talmetoyre should
                              exist. But they do not want to see the commandment carried out. After renting a school
                              and hiring a teacher they do not bother furthermore. It 
                              is not checked if the teacher really learns with the children, if the children go
                              there on a regular basis. If the head of the family sends his children to school,
                              he checks from time to time, goes to school to see if the 
                              children go there regularly. But nobody cares for the talmetoyre children. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              And it would be so easy to help. In every community with a talmetoyre a committee
                              which should pledge to visit the talmetoyre every once in a while, control whether
                              the teacher teaches as it should be, check if the children 
                              are learning something useful. With that the talmetoyre school would be put in order
                              and the teacher would fulfill his duty better. The talmetoyre would become something
                              turned into something needed: an institution constituting 
                              a fear of God in our children.

                              inform the tsar that he still has friends in the world, the antisemites. Therefore,

                              downfall. The tsar should know that Jews all over the world are not his friend and
                              do not wish him kindness.

As it is, they are still subjects of the tsar and had to adhere

The Polish, the Finnish, the Armenians, the

                              and were not able to lift their heads, are beginning to move strongly. Until now,
                              there has not been a revolution, it is still too early for this because <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> is still too 
                              strong and could squash every revolution. However, the preparations have already begun.
                              All parties have released calls and proclamations which announce that the present
                              situation is very important. Finally, scores can be 
                              settled and the tsar will be forced to provide the country with more freedom. However,
                              the proclamations warn the people to not organise demonstrations or revolutions because
                              this will not lead to victory. But those who are 
                              able to read between the lines understand that the opposite is meant. They are yelling:
                              “No revolutions!” but they mean: “Prepare for the day the revolution will start. The
                              Russian government is also deeply troubled. At the 
                              beginning of the war, the government organised patriotic demonstrations in every bigger
                              city during which the imperial was celebrated and “Hurray” was being yelled. By now,
                              the demonstrations have stopped. The government is 
                              afraid that between the patriotic demonstrations there will also be non-patriotic
                              ones. Between those who yell: “Hurray” will be mingled with those who yell “Down with

                              Furthermore, every and any gathering and demonstrations are suppressed.

                              The Jewish people are confronted with the question: how should we behave in case a
                              revolution breaks out? There are a lot of hot-headed Russian Jews who cannot wait
                              to see <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> 
                              fall. It is very likely that they will participate in a revolutionary movement. Generally,
                              Jews are provoked by the government. They will be forced to donate huge sums of money
                              for the means of war. Several big Jewish 
                              communities had to donate thousands of rubles. Furthermore, the Jews have not forgotten
                              the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place015" target="_blank">Kishinev</a></span> trials which is taking place

                              every day at the moment. As this leads to dereliction and them doing whatever they
                              want, some Russian newspapers have the audacity to demand the Jews to forgive and
                              forget everything and instead be Russian patriots who want to

                              brothers? Every one of us should donate to their possibilities for war purposes. Let

Treating Jewish people as 
                              horrible and cruel and simultaneously demand patriotism and sacrifices - this already
                              oversteps every possible mark for the calmest person to lose their temper.

                              But despite it all, the Russian Jews need to stay calm and not be tempted to revolt.
                              Jewish people alone will not accomplish anything, because they are too weak and dispersed
                              over various districts. They do not form one uniformly 
                              organised mass and can not win themselves alone. However, if they join other revolutionaries,
                              they will throw the baby out with the bathwater. Whatever way the revolution will
                              end, there will be no benefit for the Jewish people. 
                              History has taught us that everyone who utilises Jewish support and therefore comes
                              to power and influence will sooner or later forget the Jews once they are not needed
                              anymore. We already saw that in 1848 and on other occasions 
                              as well. The only right thing for Jewish people to do is to keep calm, to not be goaded
                              or upset. They do not need to be patriotic because <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> does not deserve that, they do 
                              not need to overexert themselves and donate money if they are not being forced to
                              do so. On the other hand, they also do not need to be revolutionaries. “What’s lost
                              is lost!” <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> 
                              will fall into other hands, the war will end it, it will fall down and down until

                              is an illiberal ruled country, which oppresses its whole citizenship, Jew or not.
                              The Polish, the Armenians, the Finish are being particularly persecuted. If Jewish

                              They have a parliament, free press, freedom of thought and similar laws as in every
                              European country. However, the 350,000 Jews living there are being oppressed and persecuted.
                              Every citizen lives freely and unrestricted, only the Jewish 
                              people live in fear and fright. Their situation is bitter and the hatred towards them

No! That does not match with a civilised land. Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1048169" target="_blank">Berlin congress in 1848</a> 
                              only allowed <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place068" target="_blank">Romania</a></span> to be an independent country if the Jewish people were given the same laws as all
                              citizens of the country. The Romanian laws do not mention the word “Jew”. The smart
                              
                              Romanians speculated by putting in the word “foreign” instead of “Jew”. Every citizen

                              “Jews”. 
                              Although they are born in the country like their parents and grandparents, served
                              in the military, bear the weight of the country as everyone else - but they are still
                              “foreigners” - and “foreigners” do not have any rights in 
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place068" target="_blank">Romania</a></span>. Foreigners are not allowed to live in villages, foreigners are not allowed to supply
                              the government, foreigners are not allowed to be lawyers, pharmacists, or labourers
                              
                              because whoever owns a bigger factory has to employ primarily domestic workers and
                              not “foreigners”. The Romanian Jews are “foreigners” in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place068" target="_blank">Romania</a></span>, but they do not have another 
                              home as they are indeed Romanians. Nobody attends to them, nobody cares about them.
                              The great powers who signed the Treaty of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place031" target="_blank">Berlin</a></span> protested a few times against this poor treatment

The powers on their side do not bother intermingling
                              with the country’s “inner” affairs because of the Jewish people - they are 
                              still only <em>Jews</em> after all.

                              people consist mostly of farmers 
                              and are not very intelligent. The ministers, the generals, the high officials and
                              the deputies
                              </p>

                              of parliament are mostly immigrated Greeks and Bulgarians who exploits the Romanian
                              people and control it however they want because they are afraid that the Romanian
                              people should not wake up and let themselves be exploited by other 
                              external forces as they want to keep <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place068" target="_blank">Romania</a></span> in darkness and fear as it always is with the <em>Jews</em>. The Jew is an exploiter, a fraud, he does not work and lives 
                              off the hard work of the Romanian people - that is what they yell regularly so the
                              people do not notice they are being skinned by their own representatives. - The Romanian
                              people are naturally indulgent and lived well alongside the 
                              Jews, only the foreign exploiters set the people against the Jewish people. 
                              </p>

                              Moreover, there are two parties in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place068" target="_blank">Romania</a></span> after all: liberal and conservative. Both fight each other and every now and then
                              another party comes into power. Every party wants to show the 
                              people that they are better and as the country is poor and it is hardly possible to
                              create something new, they all want to pass more laws against the Jewish people. With
                              that it can show the nation: “Look! We protect you against the Jewish 
                              exploiters!” They talk the farmers into believing that if they take the piece of bread
                              away from the Jew, the farmer will be better off. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>   
                              The Romanian Jews are of course tired of suffering from all these persecutions, in
                              the end they emigrate. Whenever times are bad in the country, hundreds of families
                              emigrate at once. Everyone will remember the sad memories which were made 
                              three years ago as the Romanian emigrants walk hundreds of miles or they are put into
                              separate wagons like criminals, as they roamed around in every bigger city and aroused
                              pity on their whole world with their sad state. Back then the 
                              Romanian government was ashamed of their actions and started to deter the Jews from
                              emigrating. They made it more difficult to obtain passports and to cross the border.
                              They also promised to ease the exemption laws under which the 
                              Romanian Jews were living. - But as soon as emigration steadied, the persecution and
                              oppression of Jews commenced to happen like before. Because of the laws of exemption
                              under which the Jews are suffering from, the Jewry is suffering 
                              as well. As the Jewish people there are viewed as “foreigners” the government does
                              not recognise their municipalities and communities. The rabbis have no say and no
                              influence, schools have also been closed down on multiple occasions as 
                              “foreigners” are not allowed to operate schools… The government has promised several
                              times to improve the situation and to introduce an organisation for the community
                              - but as usual, it does not keep its word.

The judge attempts to cover up the truth with great effort. Under no

                              suppress and persecute Jews severely to the degree of wanting to gloss over the whole
                              affair and not wanting to be bothered by it anymore.

                              took place. Fifteen witnesses swore to have seen it all. Still, they were sentenced

We found interesting information about Hungarian Jews as estate owners in a Christian

                              participate in patriotism like the Russians do, you should remember what happened

His eyes radiated fear, his gaze filled with anger.
                              He went to the door and called for the rabbi. However, not with a friendly expression
                              as he has always been 
                              when he came to him. Only one was able to recognise in this face that he was mad.
                              However, he welcomed the rabbi friendly and offered him a seat.
                              </p>

                              in world matters as well as politics is greatest of all Jewish Rabbis. You probably
                              also know about the  uprising against the Roman regiment.

                              “Gracious prince! - answered the rabbi. You honour me and recognise me as a prudent
                              and intelligible man in politics and knowledge about the matters of war, but truthfully
                              I do not merit this honour. My knowledge in politics only relates to my poor brothers
                              who seek advice.

                              The prince was engrossed in thought, he acted as if he did not hear what the rabbi
                              said to him, but wanted to state his plan and again said to the rabbi:

                              After these words the prince stayed quiet again and waited until the rabbi answered.
                              However, the rabbi did not speak up and did not ask the prince what significance this
                              conversation holds and why the prince is telling him this 
                              whole story which the rabbi already knows about and cannot help in any way. 
                              </p>

                              “I think Emperor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person045" target="_blank">Rudolf</a></span> to be a strong and brave fighter who will not subordinate any time soon. He promises
                              his fellow combatants honour and prosperity as why they run against 
                              the greatest dangers and will not let themselves be defeated. Thus, venerable rabbi,
                              is the government calling upon the every peoples and every nation in unison who are
                              protected by his power, to prepare and gear up for war in 
                              order to prove their loyalty. Your people on the other hand, the Jewish have not prepared
                              to fight in a battle and have not studied any armament to prove their loyalty to the
                              fatherland and their love to our propitious emperor. 
                              As they do not support monetarily and instead of picking up weapons to fight against
                              the enemy, they should protect the emperor’s finances.”

                              Although the rabbi knew from before that the prince is having this conversation because
                              of money, his heart lightened up like in the beginning as the prince started talking
                              to him. He replied to the prince:
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              “There are a lot of fighters going to battle. The soldier who fights in battle, defending
                              his fatherland with his own blood, dies on the battlefield with honour, others immediately
                              going to his spot. But the losers who have 
                              lost their wealth and trade, whose houses burn down with the rest of their belongings;
                              who should be able to compensate for the losses? We Jews know exactly what our duty,
                              our obligation to the fatherland and our emperor, 
                              who protects us against raiders and greedy people, is. We will pay every tax and every
                              compensation the government bestows on us with pleasure. Cheerfully we will gather
                              every charitable gift from our rich brothers who are 
                              able to pay for the poor ones as well. The capitalists should give money to those
                              who are not wealthy. We will try as hard as possible. Then you will see, gracious
                              prince, that the war taxes we may pay, is not something new that

                              we should be able to fulfill easily. It has been around ten years since we started
                              paying war taxes patiently and have become impoverished. Nothing remained, but real
                              property, but we do not own money or valuables anymore. 
                              Still we cannot evade the government’s will completely and I strive as much as I can
                              to call in a meeting where we can discuss how to best help the rulers. I promise in
                              my honour that we will do whatever is possible to

                              The main talking point these days is the conflict between <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span>. Now it would be interesting to turn to a little 
                              bit of history which occurred two hundred years ago. This is a story about how <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">Carl XII</a></span>, the young king of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place197" target="_blank">Sweden</a></span> defeated

                              and had an army of 80,000 men. With this story, the reader will see that in the matter
                              of war, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> is not hopeless against <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> 
                              which has considerably more soldiers and battleships than them. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The history in this case shows that those who are stronger in numbers do not automatically
                              come out on top. A successful war stems from the soldiers' supremacy and willingness
                              to sacrifice as well as the skills and expedition of their superiors.

                              The founder of the Russian kingdom, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person077" target="_blank">Peter the Great</a></span>, craved to be a great victor and wanted to have a harbour on the Eastern <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place198" target="_blank">Baltic Sea</a></span> 
                              to carry out his plans. He wanted the province of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place199" target="_blank">Ingria</a></span>. The Swedes occupied it and he decided to take it away with force. Hence, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person077" target="_blank">Peter</a></span> 
                              formed an alliance with the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person079" target="_blank">king</a></span> of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place067" target="_blank">Poland</a></span> to seize the piece of land he cast an eye on from <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place197" target="_blank">Sweden</a></span>.

                              and hunger. They are born with a craving for war and are more virtuous than being
                              capable of acting.

                              Noticing the danger, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">King Carl</a></span> gave up the debauched he was leading and dressed as a simple soldier from then on.
                              Before he did not meddle in the proceedings of his ministers. But right at the critical
                              
                              moment when the ministers deliberated on the upcoming danger. Some proposed to engage
                              and the king surprised everyone with his courageous demeanor.

                              “Gentleman”, he yelled with a steady voice, “I am determined to never start an unjust
                              war and to never capitulate from a just one, unless the enemy is destroyed. My resolution
                              is firm. I want to attack the first one who wants to start, the rest should be careful
                              not to do it again.

                              His old ministers were quite surprised and grasped his declaration of war in admiration.

                              was only eighteen years back then. At the same time, the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person079" target="_blank">Polish king</a></span> attacked <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place202" target="_blank">Riga</a></span>, the capital of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place204" target="_blank">Livonia</a></span> 
                              (Swedish land). And the tsar, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person077" target="_blank">Peter the Great</a></span>, marched eastward with an army of 160,000 men. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place202" target="_blank">Riga</a></span> was defended by <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person081" target="_blank">Graf Dahlberg</a></span>, 
                              an eighty year old Swedish general who withheld the enemy with a rare, fiery bravery.
                              The result was that after the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person079" target="_blank">Polish king</a></span> could not occupy the city under any circumstances, he saw it as justification to
                              besiege the city.

While it has already waged war, three Russian
                              envoys were in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place181" target="_blank">Stockholm</a></span> (<span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place197" target="_blank">Sweden</a></span>) 
                              who swore that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> only wants peace.

He had to take revenge on <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place197" target="_blank">Sweden</a></span> to take away a whole province.

Just like today’s diplomats found with
                              the Cossacks.

                              So, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person077" target="_blank">Peter the Great</a></span> marched in the lead of his great army until he reached the city of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place205" target="_blank">Narva</a></span>. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">King Carl</a></span> immediately rushed out 
                              of the city to help. Although the Russians had 150 cannons with them, they were not
                              able to invade the city and were shot down like stars  by the Swedish artillery. The
                              city did not have a stronghold and the defending army numbered only 1,000 men. Still,
                              
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person077" target="_blank">Peter the Great</a></span>’s army could not come close to the city.

                              brought 30,000 more men and wanted to circle <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person077" target="_blank">Peter</a></span> so that if he went to the city he needed to break through his army. 
                              </p>

He rode alone at the top of his army and did not wait for his regiment who were
                              farther behind. That is how he found 
                              himself with 8,000 men (the others were farther behind) against the first partition
                              of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person077" target="_blank">Peter the Great</a></span>’s army. He soon decided to break the enemy lines although he was aware of the numbers.
                              At that point there were 5,000 soldiers at a passage 
                              between rocky mountains. There, hundred men could repulse a massive army. - The courageous
                              attack of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">Carl</a></span>’s army alarmed the Russians that they wondered about the size of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">Carl</a></span>’s army and ran 
                              away after the first meeting. As the 5,000 soldiers

                           <p>
                              fled, further 20,000 were awe-struck at a point further down and this distressed a
                              third Russian camp. That is how King <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">Carl</a></span> broke through the Russian camps and as he saw that as three particularly massive
                              victories he was undeterred. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Finally, he and his exhausted army arrive at the strongest Russian camp with 80,000
                              men. Not letting his soldiers rest, he soon gave the command to attack. One of his
                              generals advised him against it, pointing out the great danger of battle. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">Carl</a></span> 
                              answered him yelling: “What! Do you doubt that my 8,000 virtuous Swedes can beat those
                              80,000 Russians!” Later he realised that he had been too harsh to his general and
                              tried to convince him calmly that they would certainly win. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Thus, marched the small army against the Russians whose numbers outranged them 1:10
                              on November 30th 1700. During the first attack, the Swedes threw snow they carried
                              with them at the Russians, but the Russians endured that. Then the real battle began.
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">Carl</a></span> 
                              charged against the tsar’s quarters, but he did not know that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person077" target="_blank">Peter the Great</a></span> accumulated 40,000 men. During the enemy’s first hail of bullets, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">King Carl</a></span> was hit by one in the neck, but the bullet got stuck 
                              in his kerchief without hurting him. His horse was shot, but he quickly obtained another
                              horse and threw himself into battle again with even more courage. After a three-hour
                              battle <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">Carl</a></span>'s army broke through the enemy’s moat. He continued chasing half of 
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person077" target="_blank">Peter</a></span>’s army - 40,000 men - with half of his own army - 4,000 men. He chased them to the
                              river <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place207" target="_blank">Narva</a></span>. As the enemy was on a bridge, said bridge collapsed and soon the river was full
                              of Russian corpses. 
                              The rest who survived returned to their camp which they defended for a while, but
                              then finally surrendered to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">Carl</a></span> who welcomed the officers with honour and generosity, like on his own court.

                              The other half of the Russians stopped attacking. 8,000 Russians were killed and several
                              more drowned, but they still had enough soldiers to not let the second half of the
                              Swedes pass. The Swedish only lost 600 men.

                              It became night and the battle was paused. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">King Carl</a></span> made plans through the whole night how to rescue the second half of his army but
                              at daybreak, as the Russian general found out about the pleasant accommodation the
                              army’s official experienced, he capitulated. 
                              Soon, the Russian general marched into the Swedish camp with 30,000 men. The soldiers
                              placed down their weapons in front of the king’s feet. As they marched with him shortly
                              after, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person078" target="_blank">Carl</a></span> marched into <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place205" target="_blank">Narva</a></span>. 
                              He later returned the swords to the Russian officials and helped them out financially.
