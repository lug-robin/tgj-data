                           <p>
                              A few weeks ago in “The Genuine Jew”, we printed an article touching upon the upcoming
                              cultus elections in <a href="place002" target="_blank">Lviv</a>. The author proved how important this question is and how necessary it 
                              has become for us Jews. We should show interest in this issue. However, up until today,
                              our city keeps silent concerning this question. Nothing is heard about it, nobody
                              talks about it as if it is something unimportant, not worth wasting any word on it.
                              
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              I tried inquiring the reason for this silence, but no matter who I asked I got the
                              same answer: “Why bother talking about it? Why bother doing anything about it? It
                              won’t help anything. Everyone knows that whoever is wanted by the 
                              campaigner will be elected. No agitation, assembly, or protest will help! Why should
                              we make a fool out of ourselves? We will be laughed at after the elections anyways.”
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Are those claiming this right? Are they right in refraining from any activity and
                              letting everything remain the same because they are unsure whether they win on their
                              first go? It might be true that they won’t achieve bringing 
                              order into our religious community right away. But are we automatically exempt from
                              trying to improve things at all? “You do not have to finish the work, but you are not freed from it” our religious leaders have already said. 
                              If we cannot manage to introduce a new culture office on the first try, we will achieve
                              it on the second or third go. But first, we have to start, otherwise it will never
                              come to an end. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              However, it is not completely true because these few campaigners do anything they
                              want. Moreover, it is impossible to seize control. Of course, because of <em>these</em> campaigners only <em>other</em> 
                              campaigners of the same kind come as well. Instead of ambitious overachievers, other
                              ambitious overachievers arrive. It’s only about the function, not the subject. If
                              the opposition, another party, wants Mr S. S. to be the cultus 
                              officer, instead of Mr. N. N., then there is no chance of improvement. The people
                              cannot be excited for single people. Something tangible has to be aimed for, a cultus
                              programme has to be presented and the whole system has to be 
                              changed. If we present the people with suggestions on how to improve our situation,
                              we will be able to inspire the people for the elections. It will be apparent that
                              the agitation works, that the campaigner’s powers will dwindle 
                              and that not those men who are wanted by the campaigners will be elected, but those
                              the people demand.

                              A programme! That’s what’s missing. Every party has a meticulously constructed programme
                              which clearly states what they want to do and what they demand.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              However, we pious Jews settle for complaining about how our current situation is bad,
                              that the current conditions are not what they are supposed to be - but we don’t state
                              what we want or demand. How then, do we think a municipality 
                              should be led and administered - that is why our voice isn’t heard, that is why we
                              don’t have any influence, that is why nobody is asking for us and doesn’t care for
                              our wants, needs, and desires. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              So, if we want to get our will in the upcoming elections, it is necessary to call
                              a meeting and elect a committee which should work out a plain and detailed programme
                              and publish it. Every Jew should know what we demand, what we are 
                              missing and how our needs should be met. We don’t need to care about the specific
                              people yet, we don’t need to choose our candidates yet; who should be elected, for
                              what, with what objective and in what direction. - If we know what 
                              we want to do, the Jewish voters will clearly know about it and the campaigners cannot
                              work their magic. We will receive a cultus office how it ought to be. A <em>Jewish</em> cultus office for a <em>Jewish</em> 
                              religious community. Not only in <em>name</em>, but also in <em>spirit</em>.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Therefore, brothers, God-fearing and devout ones, pious and honest Jews, commence
                              the movement, wake up and start caring a bit about for the benefit of the community
                              - and may God bless the work of your hands.

                              <a href="place232" target="_blank">Athens</a>. A Jew and a Greek had a dispute in the port city <a href="place233" target="_blank"><em>Kalamata</em></a> which turned into a brawl in which the Greek was 
                              killed. Several antisemites immediately started to yell that the Jews killed a Christian
                              to use his blood for matzo. The people gathered in front of the house where the Jew
                              lived and threw stones at it. The Jews lived in great fear, they 
                              closed their doors and windows and hid in the attics and basements. The military needed
                              to intervene and occupy the Jewish quarter. The mob was agitated and incited. The
                              antisemitic papers stir up hatred against Jews and excesses are feared 
                              to start in other Greek cities.

                              For a few years already, the antisemites have been thinking up stories for Passover,
                              to refresh the old, foolish lies of ritual murders. No explanation or proof is helping.
                              One word is enough for the mob to be ready to take revenge on the 
                              Jews. A lot of Jewish lives have been destroyed because of that. The Jewish people live in fear and terror. How long still,
                              will the Jews be prosecuted ? !

                           <p>
                              <a href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a>. The Austrian parliament works jointly again for a bit more than a week. Almost every
                              day, long sessions are held - but the consultations are without use or objective.
                              The 
                              Czechs are obstructing, spend whole days with stupid proposals and votes. For every
                              little thing they request roll-call votes. This means: Every representative is called
                              by their name and asked whether he votes “yes” or “no”. If a few of 
                              these votes are requested in one day, the whole day is lost. Any persuasion the government
                              tried in the Polish club  to coax the Czechs to let off the obstruction did not work.
                              The Czechs stand in one place and claim: Until their demands 
                              are not met, they will not stop with their blockage. Their main demands are: the internal
                              administrative language in <a href="place026" target="_blank">Bohemia</a> should be Czech, meaning that the commerce between two courts 
                              should be held in Czech. Then they demand a Czech university in <a href="place234" target="_blank">Brno</a> (the capital of <a href="place027" target="_blank">Moravia</a>). The Germans are against these postulations 
                              and claim that once they budge, the Czechs will filibuster once more and the government
                              will not be able to find a solution. - There has been a solution to fight the obstruction,
                              namely changing the procedural rules. This means that any 
                              and all points on the agenda allowing obstruction are to be changed; the roll-call
                              votes and so one. This was supposed to be the right remedy. But we have seen in <a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a> that merely 
                              threatening to do so stopped the filibuster in parliament. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              However, there’s a big difference between <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> and <a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a>. In <a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a> a majority 
                              party sits in parliament, the government is therefore made up of members of the parliament.
                              They are an important pillar and can do whatever they want, even with force. Then
                              again in <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> 
                              the ministry consists of officers, the ministers were civil servants before. They
                              did not have any commerce in parliament. The government is not only one main party,
                              it has to rely on support from different parties from time to time. Soon 
                              the Germans support it, soon the Polish, soon the Czechs do and so on. No one party
                              can support changing the procedural rules completely. Each party has to count on filibustering
                              themselves one time or another and they do not want to tie 
                              their hands now in case they need them later. Moreover, the Germans don’t bother anymore.
                              They fear that via changing the agenda
                              </p>
                           
                           <p align="center">[2]</p>
                           
                           
                           <p>
                              obstruction will be made impossible and the government will give in to the Czechs,
                              allowing all their demands and the Germans have to sit by and watch. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The government is at its loss. The minister president, Dr <em><a href="person004" target="_blank">Kerber</a></em> is a capable politician, but he cannot do anything against the parties’ perseverance.
                              He is always 
                              solving the situation by sending the parliament home and implements all laws via §
                              14. Still, he is still calling the parliament as a formality shortly and sends them
                              home again if it becomes evident that it is incapable of functioning. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Paragraph 14 is a convenient resource. It says that if a law needs to be passed outside
                              parliament meetings which cannot wait until the next meeting, the government can introduce
                              it temporarily by imperial decree signed by all ministers. Then, 
                              when the parliament meets again, it has to be presented to them for approval within
                              four weeks. For now, the government has found a solution by passing the laws via §
                              14. Afterwards, the parliament is called and the law is presented to them. 
                              Admittedly, the parliament does not hurry discussing it. That is why currently, for
                              example, there are 64 of these imperial decrees which the government passed in the
                              past year. But this does not matter. The decree has to only be presented 
                              to the parliament by law. Whether the discussions are finished, is not mentioned in
                              the legislation. Only if the parliament does not want to pass a law, it becomes null.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              This is the great political question: what controls Austrian internal politics. Several
                              smaller questions are added to that. For example, the Italians have demanded for several
                              years already, that an Italian university shall be built in 
                              <a href="place064" target="_blank">Trieste</a>. At first, the government did not want to give in, but agreed to it finally, but
                              only in principle. This means that the government promised to erect a university,
                              not in 
                              <a href="place064" target="_blank">Trieste</a>, but another city. Now, the government actually presented to the parliament a law
                              by which an Italian university shall be built in <a href="place212" target="_blank">Rovereto</a>, 
                              <a href="place235" target="_blank">Tyrol</a>. The government chose this city especially because mainly Italians live there while
                              <a href="place064" target="_blank">Trieste</a> is inhabited by Slavs as well. Demonstrations 
                              between Italians and Slavs because of that, but the Italians complain. They only want
                              their university in <a href="place064" target="_blank">Trieste</a>, because <a href="place064" target="_blank">Trieste</a> is the 
                              biggest Italian city in <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a>. Demonstrations are planned for all Italian cities and the Italian delegates threaten
                              to obstruct as well if the government does not give in.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The archbishop of <a href="place236" target="_blank">Olomouc</a>, Dr <a href="person120" target="_blank">Kohn</a> was forced to resign from his position by the <a href="person035" target="_blank">pope</a>. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Since he was elected to be the archbishop, he had a lot to do with minor ecclesiastes
                              who agitated against him in gatherings and newspapers. He acted very strictly against
                              the agitators. He escalated some cases and the situation got worse to an 
                              extent that the new pope called him to <a href="place107" target="_blank">Rome</a> to render an account about his operations. As it seems, the government agreed to
                              discharge him because he was not liked by the government. The bishopric of 
                              <a href="place236" target="_blank">Olomouc</a> is the biggest in <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a>. The local bishops (they also carry the title “prince spiritual”) are usually of
                              the highest nobility - suddenly a 
                              common citizen was elected - that disgruntled the nobility. All in all, the pope thanked
                              him for his services, granted him 36,000 crowns in yearly pension and nominated him
                              for cardinal. - In other countries, this case would clearly be seen as an 
                              ecclesiastical matter which has no business with politics. However, in <a href="place236" target="_blank">Olomouc</a>, everything becomes political. Germans and Czechs alike live together, in the episcopal
                              district of <a href="place236" target="_blank">Olomouc</a>. 
                              The Germans demand a German bishop to be elected, the Czechs want a Czech one. And
                              the government does not know what to do.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              All these small things together resulted in an inability to bring order to <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a>. Either the Imperial Assembly has to be consulted privately and arrange new elections,
                              hoping the new parliament will be 
                              better. Or the government has to abdicate and a new government has to be appointed
                              - hopefully the new government can establish order easier.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              In contrast, all is well in <a href="place009" target="_blank"><em>Hungary</em></a>. The opposition relented, and the recruitment act for 1903 was approved. Soon, the
                              makeship budget and the recruitment act for 1904 will be approved as well.

                              of earnings and expenses) for 1905. The Austrian government can be jealous of its
                              Hungarian colleagues, but the Austrian peoples can still learn from 
                              <a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a>, how the most important interests of the country are handled once it doesn’t care

                              The Viennese paper “<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15805615" target="_blank">Deutsches Volksblatt</a>” printed an article not long ago about the wealth of Baron <a href="person122" target="_blank">Rothschild</a>, chief of the Viennese branch of the millionaire 
                              family. Following was written in the article.
                              </p> 
                           
                           <p>
                              “This year’s balance of the Viennese house concluded with an active balance with a
                              surplus of 11,116,594,672 crowns
                              </p>

                           <p>
                              Therefore, the Viennese house alone owns more than 11 thousand million crowns! If
                              we take an interest of only 4 % - although <a href="person122" target="_blank">Rothschild</a>, who is involved in 14 operations on a high level, receives likely more than 10 %
                              - 
                              the boss of the Viennese house receives a yearly income of around 440 million crowns.
                              According to the Mairente (Austrian government bond), the Viennese chief “only” owns
                              124,264,000 crowns, but on the other hand more than 132 million crowns in Austrian
                              gold reserves, 
                              over 128 million in crown reserves, 122 million in bonds for the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q466350" target="_blank">Elisabeth Railway</a>, over 121 million in Hungarian crown rent with 4 %, 70 million in February rent and
                              the current gigantic sum of over 200 million crowns! 
                              <a href="person123" target="_blank">Albert Rothschild</a> additionally owns 28,500 <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q372974" target="_blank">North Railway</a> shares which are valued at 179,550,000 crowns, 120,000 shares of the Viennese credit
                              bank which are valued 
                              at around 80 million. Rothschild also owns French securities valued at 1,231 million
                              and English ones even at 2374 million. Estates and commodities are worth 165 million
                              according to the assets of the industrial enterprises: oil springs, iron deposits,
                              mines, [and so on italic].

                              To illustrate the <a href="person122" target="_blank">Rothschild</a> profitableness it is sufficient to provide one number: Baron <a href="person122" target="_blank">Rothschild</a>’s share in the oil springs in <a href="place238" target="_blank">Baku</a> 
                              alone yielded a revenue of 98,289,865 crowns! These revenues alone are a fortune!”

                           <p>
                              The words of the “Deutsche Volksblatt” should not be believed even if you are an honest
                              Jew. The “Deutsche Volksblatt” is the most antisemitic of all antisemitic papers in
                              <a href="place007" target="_blank">Vienna</a>. Their chef and executive editor is the well-known 
                              antisemite <a href="person124" target="_blank">Vergani</a>. The paper is world-famous and known as the “dumbest newspaper in Vienna”. When the
                              Austrian <a href="person125" target="_blank">finance minister</a> was asked about the minimal taxes 
                              <a href="person122" target="_blank">Rothschild</a> pays in comparison to his wealth based on this article, he answered that he did not
                              count Rothschild’s money and is unaware where the “Deutsche Volksblatt” got these
                              numbers from. Still, the public is included to believe 
                              what “the dumbest paper in Vienna” and a German-American paper says in this case:
                              
                              </p> 
                           
                           <p>
                              The Viennese <a href="person122" target="_blank">Rothschild</a> alone has over 2 billion (2 thousand million) dollars of wealth. The American celebrities
                              are too insignificant compared to that. Their richest, <a href="person126" target="_blank">Rockefeller</a> 
                              is believed to still be far away from his first billion. However, is also the founder
                              of the house <a href="person126" target="_blank">Rockefeller</a> while the dynasty <a href="person122" target="_blank">Rothschild</a> is in its third or fourth generation. 
                              The notes of <a href="person122" target="_blank">Rothschild</a>’s wealth show that he owns over 4,000 million crowns in government bonds, but his
                              ownership in oil springs is more profitable. The Londonese Rothschild specialised
                              in mercury and copper.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The undertakings of the American bigheads bring in more money than the <a href="person122" target="_blank">Rothschild</a>’s ones. They don't really care for funds as it doesn’t bring in the cash, petroleum
                              yields more than 50 % for the Rockefellers, steel even more. 
                              The American big capitalists will surpass the European ones as time goes on. But for
                              now they need to be careful as they would be tapped on the fingers. <a href="person127" target="_blank">Morgan</a> experienced that last summer when he was pinned down with the Northern 
                              Pacific Railway last summer. <a href="person122" target="_blank">Rothschild</a>, who influences the London market strongly, called him on the carpet and the American
                              tycoon was forced to break it off with his domestic enemies.

                              fortress is still strong enough to endure longer.

                              downright horrible. Provision and ammunition (powder) is lacking, most 
                              of the city has been destroyed. The majority of the ships in the battle harbour are
                              also heavily damaged. Nothing can be done against the enemy.

                              they are in the middle of the sea and cannot return to the harbour because the Japanese
                              are waiting for them.

                              of the more peculiar things. The hand is encased in a glass frame and consists of
                              2,200 parts of which 112 are wheels. The hand shows seconds, minutes, hours, day,
                              week, 
                              month and year as well as the zodiac signs. The sun, the moon, stars including  dawn
                              and sunset as well as the correct position of celestial bodies which show solar and
                              lunar eclipses. The calendar is one of the weirder things on the clock because it
                              is an everlasting and complete calendar which adjusts itself and displays every holiday
                              of the upcoming year as they 
                              are not always on the same day. A glass sphere represents the earth and mimics the
                              same movements and the position of the seven planets. Over hundred movable pictures
                              and figures extend the work and every quarter hour is announced by an angel on the
                              left side of the field. Two angles strike the quarter hour which are situated at an
                              angle. Farer behind two figures 
                              appear symbolising the four ages of humans. On the right side the angel of death appears
                              killing with his sword on the clock face. When the clock strikes the hour the middle
                              aged angel appears from the second angle holding an hourglass. At the same time an
                              angel appears from the right side and blows a trumpet. Allegorical figures are situated
                              beneath a roof, symbolising 
                              the seasons. On the left side is a rooster which starts flapping, craning its neck,
                              opening his beak to scream three times five minutes before midday. In “spring”, the
                              allegorical figure shows a cuckoo from above and a quail from the left side, screeching
                              seven times in “summer”. An ox lying down on his knees symbolises “autumn” and “winter”
                              is represented by a lion. 
                              The clock also has a bell which plays melodies five minutes after the full hour, lasting
                              a minute each. The work has twelve smaller bells and the music volute has 997 needles.

                              The paper on which we write and print nowadays is made out of rags. The way to process
                              rags to paper was invented 900 years ago and the invention got popular in Europe over 200 years ago now. Before paper was
                              invented, humans wrote on papyrus which is still used for Torah scrolls or important
                              documents. The old tribes wrote with a slate pencil on slat which were 
                              covered in wax or with colour on woods and fabric. Although more often, humans wrote
                              on leaves of a plant which grew in <a href="place013" target="_blank">Egypt</a> which was known as papyrus from which the word “paper” stems. papyrus trading was
                              very popular in <a href="place013" target="_blank">Egypt</a> because the whole world obtained its writing material from there.

                              Papyrus looks like a simple reed which grows in the water. Papyrus likes shallow,
                              still, and pure water. Its roots are thin and soft, but hardens and spreads all over
                              the bottom of the pond and therefore not far from the roots leaves can still grow.
                              Farther above the papyrus is smooth and sleek. Papyrus often grows up to 7 - 8 <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1559627" target="_blank">arshin</a>
                              in height. The top consists of many, green strands with soft, silken, aromatic blossoms.
                              The stalk from top to bottom is covered with two membranes. One is very thin and white,
                              the second one is dark green and harder. The old Egyptians made the papyrus from this
                              soft membrane.

                              At the beginning of autumn, once the plant is flowering, the uppermost skin can be
                              carefully removed; but it is not ready for writing as it is too thin. The membrane
                              is put on a marble table and another membrane is added on top of it, which is then
                              watered with water. The art of production is draining the water once the sticky parts
                              of the membranes connect and the membranes stick 
                              to each other. Then the folded up paper can be dried and need to immediately be beaten
                              with a small hammer and finally be flattened with elephant tusk. Therewith is the
                              work finished and a long piece of paper with a width of three <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2121867" target="_blank">vershok</a>.

                              In order to write on this now, it needs to be held like a scroll. A part is rolled
                              out to write on it and as the writing goes on, one side of the papyrus is rolled in
                              further while the other side is unraveled. It is non-profitable to cut the papyrus
                              apart, bend on top of each or bind together to create books or booklets as the papyrus
                              is too narrow and too much of the valuable material 
                              would be lost. Poems and smaller traditional Jewish texts were written on the papyrus.
                              That is why the writers and translators try to write in every corner of the papyrus.

                              Even nowadays papyrus scrolls were found in the Roman city <a href="place" target="_blank">Herculaneum</a> which was covered with ash during the great earthquake. Some of them are very smooth
                              and thin showing that it is not far from one of the best kinds of paper.

                              Today, papyrus became very rare, even in <a href="place013" target="_blank">Egypt</a> because the cheap paper renders papyrus unnecessary. However, long ago

                              papyrus was planted on the edge of the <a href="place248" target="_blank">Nile</a>. Papyrus is also present in the Italian island <a href="place249" target="_blank">Sicily</a>.

                              Not far away from the city <a href="place250" target="_blank">Syracuse</a>, around two thousand years ago, the <a href="person132" target="_blank">ruler</a> of Syracuse was gifted a seed of those valuable plants by the king of Egypt <a href="person133" target="_blank">Ptolemy</a>. The seeds started to flourish. Since then, papyrus has been growing in 
                              this nice, warm climate of <a href="place249" target="_blank">Sicily</a>. The Syracuse inhabitants still produce papyrus to sell it as a rarity. But no matter
                              how hard they try, they may never make paper as good as it was in old <a href="place013" target="_blank">Egypt</a>.

                              The rabbi noticed that everyone coming to him to talk also talked with his daughter
                              and when they talked to her alone, she was very sad. This aggrieved the <a href="person046" target="_blank">rabbi</a>. He loved his daughter because only she stayed with him as his 
                              <a href="person135" target="_blank">wife</a> died a few years ago. His three sons died during the great riots in <a href="place093" target="_blank">Frankfurt</a>. Only his only daughter <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> remained, a solace in his older years, because she was always very obedient. Even
                              one 
                              time when <a href="person054" target="_blank"><em>Kneppe</em></a>, the baptised, wanted to take <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> for his wife before he was baptised. <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> did not immediately say yes, but as her father the rabbi did not 
                              give his blessing <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> denied <a href="person054" target="_blank">Kneppe</a>. The same <a href="person054" target="_blank">Kneppe</a> was baptised out of annoyance and swore to take revenge on all Jews, mainly the rabbi.
                              <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a>’s 
                              father loved her dearly, because she was always very submissive. And as he noticed
                              her sadness and she not wanting to tell him why, the rabbi was very hurt. So turned
                              to his student <a href="person059" target="_blank">Asher</a>, who we already know from earlier, and said to him: 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              “My dear student, I do not need to prove my trust and love to you, I believe you are
                              convinced. So why don’t you tell me what the cause of my daughter <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a>’s tribulations are and I also see the sadness in your eyes. Surely, your troubles
                              stem from the same root. In short, my daughter does 
                              not want to share her grief with me and also does not tell me what is burdening her.
                              But you, my dear <a href="person059" target="_blank">Asher</a>, you understand that your silence causes even more pain and suffering. Now I bid
                              you, with all the respect a student has to offer to his rabbi, to tell me everything.
                              
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The student <a href="person059" target="_blank">Asher</a> answered: I want to follow you, my esteemed rabbi and I want to tell you everything:
                              Since you have been with the prince and heard what he demands, that the Jewish people
                              have to contribute a huge sum to the war, we see the villain <a href="person054" target="_blank">Kneppe</a> 
                              making circles around our house. He lurks and spies upon us at every turn. I for myself
                              am not afraid of him, because I do not believe he will find anything of merit to make
                              us liable. But I am scared in case he is looking for your daughter <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> and might want to steal her away. Four times already they have met where he wanted
                              to obstruct her passage. 
                              She was frightened and ran away. Even in the night he met her with her maid when she
                              went to visit a friend. The convert said to the maid: “Go on further, I need to talk
                              to your mistress”. <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> wanted to run away, but he held her back and did not let her continue walking until
                              she said what he wanted to hear. First, he was talking friendly with her and 
                              told her that he was only baptised because of her tenacity; because you did not want
                              to give her to him as his wife. Then he started to threaten her and said: “You should
                              know that I have a hold over you, your father, and your people. Now is still time
                              to save yourself. I am sure that your father is not able to raise all of the money
                              which is demanded of him. But you can save your father. Agree to 
                              be my wife and I will persuade the prince to leave you be. You will be honored and
                              appreciated.”
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              “And what did <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> answer the convert?” - the rabbi asked.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              “She was startled and agitated” - the student answered - that she froze like marble
                              and could not reply at all. However, <a href="person054" target="_blank">Kneppe</a> started talking anew and stated angrily: “Answer me, stupid girl! Let me hear your
                              opinion!” <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> frightened even more and wanted to tear her arm away, but he held her 
                              tightly and yelled: “You should know that if you don’t go with me willingly, your
                              father will be severely punished and I will conquer you anyways. You can still follow
                              and we will run away anyway, to a far away country. There I will convert to Judaism
                              again and will marry you in conformity with the law of <a href="place034" target="_blank">Israel</a>.” <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> 
                              did not want to listen to him any further and started to scream for help. She became
                              afraid in case the convert wanted to harm her. In one minute I was with her, punched
                              <a href="person054" target="_blank">Kneppe</a> so hard in the chest that he lost his consciousness and quickly fled the scene and
                              ran to her aunt <a href="person136" target="_blank">Hannah</a>. It took over two 
                              hours until <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> had calmed down. - All of this, my honoured rabbi, is the reason why we are constantly
                              this agitated and sad. Now, rabbi, give us advice on how to save <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a>”. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              <a href="person046" target="_blank">Meir</a> stayed seated on his chear, very nervous and thoughtful. After a few minutes he asked
                              his student: “Tell me, why were you in the same alleyway as <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> and what did you do there?”
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              “I want to tell you the truth” - the student answered “that the maid who went with
                              <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a> saw that <a href="person054" target="_blank">Kneppe</a> attacked her and quickly ran to me as she wanted me to free her, but she could not
                              find me at home. I was already after her on my own because my heart told me that something
                              bad will happen.”
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              “You shall be blessed by God” - answered <a href="person046" target="_blank">Meir</a> - you have saved and freed her. Now, leave me alone and let me think and contemplate
                              what we should do now”.
                              </p>

                              <a href="person059" target="_blank">Asher</a> went away and <a href="person046" target="_blank">Meir</a> called for his daughter <a href="person134" target="_blank">Sarah</a>. She soon came.
