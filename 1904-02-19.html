                     In almost no other country is the rabbinical question as important as it is here.
                     In more developed countries the rabbinical question has long lost importance already.
                     Nobody cares what a rabbi should be, 
                     finishing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_seminary" target="_blank">Jewish seminary</a>, having gained the title “Doctor” and being able to preach a good sermon - that already
                     is sufficient. Nobody 
                     cares whether he is a real scholar. First, the Jewish communities would not be able
                     to know that, as very few in control could study, and secondly they rely on the diploma
                     which the “Rabbi” brought back from 
                     the seminary. Nobody questions whether he is actually pious as this is not the main
                     thing… The rabbinical question, hence, is not prevalent there. - In <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hungary</em></span>, pious communities 
                     separated themselves from the progressive ones, they have created their own organisations
                     and nobody tampers with the rabbinical question; in , two Rabbis exist in every community. 
                     One is called “Kazyone-Rabbi”, which means the administrative rabbi. He is responsible
                     for the matricula, he is the governmental rabbi. Often, he does not speak a single
                     word Hebrew or Yiddish, mostly he is a 
                     lawyer, a pharmacist, an engineer or similar. He only administers money and does not
                     interfere with any Jewish matters. A second rabbi- called “Dukhovner Rabbi”, which
                     means he is the real rabbi, a scholar, a 
                     gaon, a pious Jew, who works with the Torah all day. However, the government only
                     cares about the administrative rabbi. The government  does not care about the Dukhovner rabbi and every community chooses a rabbi 
                     however they want it.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__4" class="yes-index">
                     Only here in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Galicia</span>, the rabbinical question exists and finding a solution does not seem to work. Most
                     communities need an old-style rabbi, a great scholar, a gaon, a genuine pious Jews,
                     who 
                     should devote himself to the Jewry and should be a shepherd, loyal to his religion.
                     The law needs rabbis in bigger cities to have graduated and even in the smaller cities
                     he needs to be educated to a certain point. 
                     But where does one get a rabbi who is a true scholar and has a diploma as well? As
                     this law was created on March 21st 1890, nobody was asking that question. Our leaders
                     in the big cities, our representatives in the 
                     imperial council are progressive Jews. They only wanted rabbis who can hold beautiful
                     “sermons”, who are dressed in the latest fashion and should be able to “convene with
                     people”, as they are calling it. They do not 
                     care about Jewish erudition, piousness and such and therefore this law has been passed.
                     
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__5" class="yes-index">
                     One has to admit that the government understood the pious Jews’ interests better and
                     brought more ease against the will of “our” progressive “representatives”. First they
                     introduced a transitional period in which one 
                     can continue in a traditional manner and the rabbi does not need to know Latin or
                     Greek. Another<br  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar"></br> easement was made: every rabbi who has been a rabbi before this law, even if he is
                     from a small town, can also become 
                     a rabbi in a bigger city, even if he doesn’t hold a diploma. Those who have been rabbis,
                     can continue to be one and do not need to study. If a community petitions to the government
                     to welcome a rabbi without a diploma, 
                     they will be allowed to do so. Therefore, the government makes every possible facilitation
                     for pious Jews. 
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__6" class="yes-index">
                     But the question prevails: Will it always be like this? How long can this situation
                     still last? The transitional period has long gone by and the rabbis who have already
                     been rabbis before this law will become less and 
                     less as time goes on. And if we want to make sure that the government will listen
                     and fulfil the request of the Jewish communities they need to incorporate pious rabbis
                     who do not have diplomas. Who knows if the 
                     progressive Jews who are superintendents in most communities, will allow another petition
                     - against the will of pious Jews - a “doctrine” for rabbis as it had already happened
                     in big communities like <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Drohobytsch</span>. 
                     We will write about this in the following papers. We do not need to describe the damage
                     this causes against the genuine Jewry and the dignity of the Torah. Every pious Jew
                     knows and senses that the Jewish rabbis lose 
                     their reputation. They are considered to be invited guests who are tolerated out of
                     pity. The pious Jews are the ones who mostly care about the communities, they provide
                     the money for the ritual slaughters, the tax on 
                     kosher meat, the money for bath houses for ritual immersion and the like (which progressive
                     Jews do not use nor need), now have to watch on how the money is not being given to
                     the rabbi. Out of mercy he gets to be an 
                     assistant or a teaching rabbi who receives little pay. He has no reputation, no influence,
                     he is not being questioned or listened to.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__7" class="yes-index">
                     We have seen it all, as we are watching as Jewry is becoming weaker and weaker and
                     the rabbis are being accused that they are not bridging the gap nor work towards improvements.
                     However, we alone have to acknowledge this 
                     current situation here. The rabbis do have neither the power nor the influence to
                     improve these conditions. The rabbis are not solely at fault for being silent on this.
                     What should they talk about? They alone cannot procure 
                     their dignity. The community first needs to strive to take care of the rabbinical
                     questions in order to get over the current tentative situation and create stable conditions.
                     The rabbinical question needs to be treated in 
                     a manner so the rabbis are not looked at like invited guests. They only need to enjoy
                     the respect and the reputation. Only then they are able to influence their communities,
                     only then they can bridge the gap, and 
                     strengthen the foundation for faith in religion. That’s how Jewry will be restored
                     in our community, that’s how the education of our children will become better and
                     more Jewish and everything will take a turn for the better.

                  <p id="p__7" class="yes-index">
                     But how should that happen? Which means can the communities use to reach their goals?
                     - It is not easy to answer this question in a newspaper article. The most important
                     thing is that the Jewish communities, that our 
                     ultra-orthodox brothers will come to the realisation that it can not go on like this,
                     that it has to become different and better. If they come to the realisation and want
                     to wake up from their complacent sleep und want 
                     to start changing things, they will find a way for sure to improve those conditions
                     - Hopefully my words encourage others to turn to the question, peace be upon you.

                     The war between Japan and Russia has taken up everyone’s attention around the world
                     as it seems that all other political issues, which have happened, are being forgotten
                     about. Not that anything particularly important has 
                     happened in the world, but it is well known that non-important things can become very
                     important. Furthermore, we think it is only right to inform our readers about political
                     news which happened in the last few days.

The political conditions in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Austria-Hungary</span> have not changed a lot. The parliament is closed, the delegation is still consulting
                     about the issues concerning 
                     both countries. Nothing important results from the delegations’ consultation. Both
                     the Austrian and the Hungarian delegation mostly talk about domestic politics and
                     barely touch upon foreign politics. Even when consulting 
                     about the military, military questions are barely tended to. However, in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Austria</span> it is discussed whether the minister of war is in the right: He gave the order that
                     all officers and sergeants need 
                     to know the regiment language. Meaning that if a German officer in a regiment mostly
                     of Poles, Ruthenians, Czech, Italians and suchlike, he has to know Polish or Czech
                     or Italian. Of course, the Poles, Italians, of course 
                     are very satisfied with this edict. The Germans, on the other hand, are against it
                     because this impedes the chance of becoming an officer. Not every German wants to
                     learn another language. The Hungarian delegation also 
                     mostly talks about which concessions the minister of war of Hungary is allowed to
                     make. He prematurely promises, how one says, heaven and earth. He is talking about
                     new military academies, new schools with Hungarian as 
                     the language of instruction, Hungarian officers would only serve in Hungarian regiments
                     to nurture the Hungarian national pride and suchlike. - But the opposition in Austria
                     and in Hungary<span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="anchor-pb"></span><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="pb" source=""></span> is still not satisfied. 
                     As soon as the delegation stops with their punishments and the Imperial Council opens
                     up again, they want to continue their <em>obstruction</em>.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__8" class="yes-index">
                     Nowadays, the word obstruction has become a very dangerous word in every parliament
                     which they are fearing. By obstructing, just a few delegates can interrupt the entire
                     parliament's work and the parliament cannot do 
                     anything about it. Representatives, who want to obstruct, introduce “emergency motions”
                     daily, which have to be dealt with immediately. They constantly pipe up, hold lengthy
                     speeches and request roll-call votes. This 
                     means they are not voting by raising their hands as usual, but every representative
                     is called up by name and questioned whether they agree or disagree. This type of voting
                     takes up to an hour of time and is done until 
                     the day is over. Therefore, the delegates do not get to consult about the actual subjects
                     which are on the agenda. This is done constantly. However, if the majority wants to
                     pressure the opposition forcefully to end 
                     the filibuster in order to accept a resolution or deal with emergency motions at the
                     end of the session or to use roll-call votes only for important queries, the obstructionists
                     moves on to “vociferous blockage”. They 
                     start to scream, to make noise, to rattle with the lectern, to throw books and bottles,
                     bring fiddles and whistles, play and pipe and squeal until the president has to close
                     the session. Indeed there are parliaments 
                     where there is a way to cope with the obstructionists like in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Germany</span> or in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">France</span>. There is a paragraph in the rules of proceedings by which the president has the
                     right to 
                     exclude those who disrupt the meeting for one or more sessions from the parliament.
                     However, in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Austria</span> and in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Hungary</span> a paragraph like this does not exist and the president 
                     cannot work out a solution with the obstructionists. Moreover, the obstructions in
                     these countries have endured for a few years already and nobody knows how to solve
                     it.  The parties do not want the president to finally 
                     exclude the yellers and noise-makers, every party is anxious to someday obstruct something.
                     Therefore, they do not want to block themselves already.

                     It is unknown how this all will end. In <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Hungary</span>, it might come to an end soon as the government gives the obstructionists everything
                     they want. If it is not resolved soon, the government will be 
                     dissolved. However in Austria, it is not possible to indulge with the Czech as the
                     German do not want to. It is also not possible to dissolve the government as the end
                     of the filibuster is not known.

                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Italy</span>. An alliance has been existing between <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Austria-Hungary</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Italy</span> for over 20 years. This means that both governments agreed to support each other
                     
                     in case another regiment wages war with one of them. If two countries are allied they are meant to be able to live in peace with
                     each other. This is not the case here. The Italian government conducts itself correctly
                     
                     against Austria-Hungary, but they are constantly on bad terms, because Emperor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Franz Joseph</span> did not return the Italian king’s visit to Vienna 20 years ago. However, Emperor
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Franz Joseph</span> 
                     cannot visit the Italian king in the capital <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rome</span> because the pope lives there as well who does not live peacefully next to the Italian
                     government because they have taken his state! The pope excommunicated 
                     the Italian king and will not welcome a catholic emperor like Emperor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Franz Joseph</span> if he visits the Italian king in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rome</span>. However, he proposed meeting the Italian king in another 
                     city apart from <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rome</span>. But the Italian king does not want that as he does not want to give in to the pope.
                     Moreover, the relationship between both governments is strained. The current Italian
                     King, 
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Viktor Emanuel</span>, has visited all monarchs, like the German and Russian emperors, the English king
                     or the French president - just not the Austrian emperor. The Italian people show their
                     hostility 
                     against Austria openly. The Italians insist on claiming <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Triest</span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">South Tyrol</span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Dalmatia</span>, and other countries where Italians reside and unite them with 
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Italy</span>. Regularly, Italians demonstrate in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Austria</span>, Austrian flags are burnt in the street and the Italian government is just watching.
                     First of all, it is anxious to act 
                     against their citizens; secondly, it also agrees with their people a bit, because
                     they desire <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Triest</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Dalmatia</span>. Only if the demonstrations become too intense will the government 
                     intervene as they should not act like that against a friend and ally. - The Austrian
                     government watches the demonstrations calmly but cautiously. Nobody knows how this
                     will evolve.

                     And indeed, important occurrences seem to be developing in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Italy</span>. As it has been told the last few days, <em><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Garibaldi</span></em> - son of the well-known general 
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Garibaldi</span>, who helped uniting the small Italian countries to a big Italian country - is summing
                     up voluntary states in order to potentially invade <em><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Austria</span></em> 
                     and to take away <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Triest</span> . He has already bought 10,000 rifles and guns. Volunteers from all sides are gathering
                     who want to join this national-”holy” war. - The Italian government remains silent,
                     
                     Austria as well. What can a few thousand volunteers accomplish against the Austrian
                     military? However, if we take into consideration that a war between Bulgaria and Turkey
                     - which Austria will be involved in - can break 
                     out any time, we have to admit that revolutionists can do great harm when invading
                     Austria. Austria needs to brace itself early enough. - Trivialities can easily evolve
                     into vital matters.

The war between Russia and Japan affects Turkey and its small neighbours <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Bulgaria</span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Serbia</span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Montenegro</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Greece</span>. 
                     Turkey only accepted the reforms Austria and Russia wanted Turkey to introduce in

                     to raise trouble against the 
                     reformations. Even the smaller countries on the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Balkan</span>, like <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Bulgaria</span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Serbia</span>, or , start to mingle from all directions and ready 
                     themselves for <em>war</em>. As the news is reporting, Turkey is starting to hire massive military forces from
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Syria</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Asia Minor</span> to bring them to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Macedonia</span>. 
                     Bulgaria is eagerly preparing for war and also Serbia is starting to move and rumour
                     has it that even Rumania is mobilising a military corps. Austria-Hungary wants to
                     mobilise the military corps of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Timișoara</span> and

If a war is to break out in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Turkey</span>, Austria-Hungary will have to intervene, which Russia is already fearing in the case
                     if Austria-Hungary will derive benefits from it. 
                     In any case, it is to be expected that a Bulgarian-Turkish war will be breaking out
                     soon.

                     about Russian victories although nobody believes those. The Russian Tsar <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">[Nicholas II]</span> has fallen ill because of the humiliation, he is angry with his ministers for what

                     happen in the war. He has weeped severely a couple of times.

                     The whole world’s sentiment is against Russia, citizens in every country are happy
                     about the Russian losses. Merely the Slavic peoples, like Czechs, Bulgarians, Serbs

                     Following news stories are being reported about the war’s process:
                     <br  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar"></br>After the first defeat at sea, Russia experienced further significant losses. Particularly
                     pivotal was the battle by the harbour of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Chemulpo</span>. Japan annihilated the entire Russian armament 
                     in the harbour there and sent over 20,000 soldiers on land.  As <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Chemulpo</span> is only a few hours from the Korean capital <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seoul</em></span> away, Japan has already 
                     occupied it as well. Japan is already in control of all of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span>. 
                     <br  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar"></br>
                     As Japan has already occupied <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Chempulo</span>, they have fully opened the way through <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span> and are able to deposit all of their military there. In a short space of time, 
                     they have already 100,000 men there and are able to go into battle with the Russian
                     army on land.
                     <br  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar"></br>
                     In the meantime, Japan has also attacked the Russian battleships in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Vladivostok</span> and destroyed most of them. They have fired at the most important harbour - <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Port Arthur</span> - 
                     as well and damaged the stronghold as well as wrecked most of the city. Various news
                     outlets claim that the Japanese have also settled an army there leading to Japan having
                     occupied most of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> 
                     and want to attack the Russian military from both sides.  
                     <br  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar"></br>
                     The most important Japanese victory is the destruction of the Manchurian train tracks.
                     The connection between the Russian military is therefore cut off. One part has no
                     idea what is happening with another fraction 
                     which is hugely important in a war. - Whether the Japanese military, Japanese spies
                     or the Chinese destroyed it is not known. In any case, these reports show how nifty
                     Japan is doing and planning their actions 
                     and know what they want.
                     <br  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar"></br>
                     An important query is how <em>China</em> is reacting to the war. <em>Korea</em> has completely switched over to Japan. If China will also support Japan, Russia will
                     not have any chance. 
                     The forces want China to be “neutral”, as impartial - meaning no one should involve
                     China in this war as a World War could break out then because every state has claims
                     in China. However, it seems that China will 
                     be supporting Japan if Japan emerges victorious. They want to get even with Russia
                     that way as Russia has intensely persecuted the Chinese.

                     It is not clear yet when the first war on land will take place. The Japanese movements
                     are kept in secret and it is not known where they are stationed. Any time, the Japanese
                     military could collide with the Russian 
                     one resulting in the first major battle.
                     <br  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar"></br>
                     Russian papers are spreading the news that the Japanese military had encountered the
                     Russian one a couple of times already. The Cossacks would have demolished the Japanese
                     each time. But as everyone knows, the Russian 
                     reports are lying; nobody believes them.
                     <br  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar"></br>
                     Meanwhile, Russia is mobilising their army in its entirety. Every third soldier of
                     every regiment is being sent to the battle zone. Russian citizens living abroad who
                     are liable to military service are being called back. 
                     Of course, most do not want to go. Several soldiers have also deserted the military
                     and fled over the borders because they do not want to participate in the war. It is
                     understood that Russia can lose their corps as they 
                     are losing their will to fight.

                     On the contrary, the Japanese enthusiasm for the war is high. Every imperial prince
                     was on the battleships which bombed Port Arthur and nobody was harmed. Even the Japanese
                     emperor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">[Meiji]</span> wants to 
                     join the battle which no emperor before has done.

                     Whether or not these reports are sincere cannot be answered yet. Fact is, the reforms
                     which were hoped to be introduced in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Macedonia</span> were not introduced. Macedonians are not happy with those reformation, 
                     the improvements are <em>not enough</em>. For Albanians (a savage Turkish tribe living in Macedonia) the reforms are too <em>much</em>. They claim that the Turkish government indulges the revolutionaries 
                     way too much. And because they are aware that Turkey has to give in because of the
                     forces who demand the reforms they want take matters into their own hands. They are
                     attacking the Macedonians; they steal, murder, and plunder as 
                     much as they are able to. The whole winter it has been silent. But now as it is becoming
                     warmer in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Macedonia</span> and the snow is starting to melt, Albanians are also getting started again. Several
                     places report 
                     pillaging against Macedonians. Of course, they also do not want to keep silent. Bulgaria
                     wants to intervene and Turkey, which is not afraid of Russia anymore as they are entangled
                     in the war with Japan, wants to utilise this 
                     opportunity: They want to attack Bulgaria and teach them a lesson not to start wars.
                     Via a war which Turkey would likely win they would be able to get the Macedonian question off their mind. Bulgarians are aware of their 
                     dark end and want to stop scampering. The war perils in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Turkey</span> are high and Austria will be involved in the war without a doubt. Austria will not

                     Since the start of the war between Russia and Japan it has been an open secret that
                     Japan is supported by England and the USA. Russia gnashed their teeth, but had to
                     keep silent. Once they win the war against Japan, they will 
                     settle the score with England and the USA. This hope has been crushed. Russia has
                     been demolished at sea and there is no real chance to win on land. Therefore, a dangerous
                     scheme was contrived. They realised that Japan is more

                     at some times reigned by Russia and at other times reigned by England. Lately, England

                     However, it seems Russia is making a big mistake. It might be true that England is
                     weaker than Russia on land, but how realistic is it that the war will only be waged
                     on land? England will surely retaliate on water and will destroy the 
                     Russian battleships in other Russian harbours who have survived the Japanese attacks.

                     are living there. 
                     Twenty Jewish families live in the capital <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Tokyo</span>.

Only 60 years 
                     ago Jewish people immigrated to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Japan</span> because before then they were not allowed to. In <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Japan</span>, there is freedom of religion and Jews are equal with every citizen in the country.

                     groom and a Christian bride or the other way around) took place. Those mixed marriages
                     increase constantly and the children who 
                     result from them are mostly raised Christian, those are the results of the assimilation

                     (<span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Warsaw</span>). In a small town in the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Płock</span> province, farmers wanted to destroy the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruv" target="_blank">Eruv</a> which Jewish people built to spend Shabbat there. 
                     Jewish people there stood in the farmers’ way and some were beaten. Therefore, the
                     Jews filed a suit but the judges wanted to release the farmers which led to a protest.
                     Nobody was invited to speak and in the end the farmers were 
                     exculpated. The Jewish lawyer wanted to object, but the court told him to wait until
                     the verdict was sent to him. After some weeks the lawyer still has not received the
                     verdict and turned to the court. The court told him that the 
                     verdict has long been spoken already and filed and it is therefore too late to appeal.
                     The lawyer then handed in an appeal to the senate. We are very curious whether we
                     can count on a Russian court but currently duplicity and 
                     antisemitism dominates the courts.

The Jewish emigration from <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Romania</span> increased in the past year. Two to three years ago emigration was very high. One year ago it subsided a bit. Then 1903, again 8011 Jews
                     
                     emigrated from <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Romania</span>.

Antisemitism in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">England</span> is rising again. From all sides persecution is reported on. But not only workers
                     or mobs bear grudges against Jews, but higher classes now as well. For 
                     a long time already, people have appealed to the government to create a law against
                     immigration which would hamper Jewish people to immigrate to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">England</span>. The government did not want to introduce such a law, 
                     because a free country like <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">England</span> does not want to exhibit antisemitism. - However, the government gave in now. A law
                     was presented in parliament according to which every foreigner who wants to settle
                     in 
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">England</span> needs to possess a passport and a <em>Moralitätszeugnis</em> [;a testimonial for moral behaviour]. The following three years they are then under
                     supervision of the police which should 
                     immediately deport if any wrongdoings take place. Only after five years are they able
                     to become a citizen. The government can also decide on one place where immigrants
                     should live together. - All of these clauses are directed 
                     against Jewish people. Unfortunate Jews are persecuted like this in the whole world.

                     disaster befell the Jewish community in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Settat</span>. 
                     The Jewish community, about 7,500 souls, mostly artisans and peddlers fell into misery
                     after a sudden attack. The Jewish people were praying in the synagogue when a heap
                     of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabyle_people" target="_blank">Kabyle people</a>” 
                     (wild Arabs) came riding on horses and destroyed the Jewish quarters. They plundered
                     and demolished whatever they could and took several women and children captive. Two
                     Jews have been trampled to death, children and women have been horribly beaten 
                     and tormented. Caretakers and their children have been ripped out of their beds and
                     been thrown onto the streets. Over 200 houses have been destroyed. Bread and other
                     foods have been stolen almost everywhere. The unlucky Jews have fled into 
                     all directions; nobody knew where the other one was. Some families found each other
                     only after weeks. The Arabs demand huge ransom for their prisoners. The Arab-family
                     “Oled Harim” [Oled al-Jibal] showed themselves to be benevolent. They 
                     took in many eloping Jews in their homes. One of them rode out with several families
                     to bring back to the city those who were wandering around. - A big part of the fleeing
                     ones, 700 individuals, fled to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Casablanca</span>. -

                     Back then, the rabbi used to have a lot of power and influence on their communities,

                     whatever the rabbi’s judgement was, it was accepted. The rabbi could 
                     also punish those who did not want to accept his verdict.

                     Whenever the rabbi went through the city, he always had an attendant in uniform with
                     a stick going in front of him. Behind him the rabbi and two students, one on each
