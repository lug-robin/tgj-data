                           <p>
                              In almost no other country is the rabbinical question as important as it is here.
                              In more developed countries the rabbinical question has long lost importance already.
                              Nobody cares what a rabbi should be, 
                              finishing the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1739398" target="_blank">Jewish seminary</a>, having gained the title “Doctor” and being able to preach a good sermon - that already
                              is sufficient. Nobody 
                              cares whether he is a real scholar. First, the Jewish communities would not be able
                              to know that, as very few in control could study, and secondly they rely on the diploma
                              which the “Rabbi” brought back from 
                              the seminary. Nobody questions whether he is actually pious as this is not the main
                              thing… The rabbinical question, hence, is not prevalent there. - In <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></em></span>, pious communities 
                              separated themselves from the progressive ones, they have created their own organisations
                              and nobody tampers with the rabbinical question; in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></em></span>, two Rabbis exist in every community. 
                              One is called “Kazyone-Rabbi”, which means the administrative rabbi. He is responsible
                              for the matricula, he is the governmental rabbi. Often, he does not speak a single
                              word Hebrew or Yiddish, mostly he is a 
                              lawyer, a pharmacist, an engineer or similar. He only administers money and does not
                              interfere with any Jewish matters. A second rabbi- called “Dukhovner Rabbi”, which
                              means he is the real rabbi, a scholar, a 
                              gaon, a pious Jew, who works with the Torah all day. However, the government only
                              cares about the administrative rabbi. The government  does not care about the Dukhovner rabbi and every community chooses a rabbi 
                              however they want it.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Only here in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span>, the rabbinical question exists and finding a solution does not seem to work. Most
                              communities need an old-style rabbi, a great scholar, a gaon, a genuine pious Jews,
                              who 
                              should devote himself to the Jewry and should be a shepherd, loyal to his religion.
                              The law needs rabbis in bigger cities to have graduated and even in the smaller cities
                              he needs to be educated to a certain point. 
                              But where does one get a rabbi who is a true scholar and has a diploma as well? As
                              this law was created on <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">March 21st 1890</span>, nobody was asking that question. Our leaders in the big cities, our representatives
                              in the 
                              imperial council are progressive Jews. They only wanted rabbis who can hold beautiful
                              “sermons”, who are dressed in the latest fashion and should be able to “convene with
                              people”, as they are calling it. They do not 
                              care about Jewish erudition, piousness and such and therefore this law has been passed.
                              
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              One has to admit that the government understood the pious Jews’ interests better and
                              brought more ease against the will of “our” progressive “representatives”. First they
                              introduced a transitional period in which one 
                              can continue in a traditional manner and the rabbi does not need to know Latin or
                              Greek. Another

                              easement was made: every rabbi who has been a rabbi before this law, even if he is
                              from a small town, can also become a rabbi in a bigger city, even if he doesn’t hold
                              a diploma. Those who have been rabbis, can continue 
                              to be one and do not need to study. If a community petitions to the government to
                              welcome a rabbi without a diploma, they will be allowed to do so. Therefore, the government
                              makes every possible facilitation for pious Jews. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              But the question prevails: Will it always be like this? How long can this situation
                              still last? The transitional period has long gone by and the rabbis who have already
                              been rabbis before this law will become less and 
                              less as time goes on. And if we want to make sure that the government will listen
                              and fulfil the request of the Jewish communities they need to incorporate pious rabbis
                              who do not have diplomas. Who knows if the 
                              progressive Jews who are superintendents in most communities, will allow another petition
                              - against the will of pious Jews - a “doctrine” for rabbis as it had already happened
                              in big communities like <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place106" target="_blank">Drohobytsch</a></span>. 
                              We will write about this in the following papers. We do not need to describe the damage
                              this causes against the genuine Jewry and the dignity of the Torah. Every pious Jew
                              knows and senses that the Jewish rabbis lose 
                              their reputation. They are considered to be invited guests who are tolerated out of
                              pity. The pious Jews are the ones who mostly care about the communities, they provide
                              the money for the ritual slaughters, the tax on 
                              kosher meat, the money for bath houses for ritual immersion and the like (which progressive
                              Jews do not use nor need), now have to watch on how the money is not being given to
                              the rabbi. Out of mercy he gets to be an 
                              assistant or a teaching rabbi who receives little pay. He has no reputation, no influence,
                              he is not being questioned or listened to.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              We have seen it all, as we are watching as Jewry is becoming weaker and weaker and
                              the rabbis are being accused that they are not bridging the gap nor work towards improvements.
                              However, we alone have to acknowledge this 
                              current situation here. The rabbis do have neither the power nor the influence to
                              improve these conditions. The rabbis are not solely at fault for being silent on this.
                              What should they talk about? They alone cannot procure 
                              their dignity. The community first needs to strive to take care of the rabbinical
                              questions in order to get over the current tentative situation and create stable conditions.
                              The rabbinical question needs to be treated in 
                              a manner so the rabbis are not looked at like invited guests. They only need to enjoy
                              the respect and the reputation. Only then they are able to influence their communities,
                              only then they can bridge the gap, and 
                              strengthen the foundation for faith in religion. That’s how Jewry will be restored
                              in our community, that’s how the education of our children will become better and
                              more Jewish and everything will take a turn for the better.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              But how should that happen? Which means can the communities use to reach their goals?
                              - It is not easy to answer this question in a newspaper article. The most important
                              thing is that the Jewish communities, that our 
                              ultra-orthodox brothers will come to the realisation that it can not go on like this,
                              that it has to become different and better. If they come to the realisation and want
                              to wake up from their complacent sleep und want 
                              to start changing things, they will find a way for sure to improve those conditions
                              - Hopefully my words encourage others to turn to the question, peace be upon you.

                              political issues, which have happened, are being forgotten about. Not that anything
                              particularly important has happened in the world, but it is well known that non-important
                              things can become very important. Furthermore, 
                              we think it is only right to inform our readers about political news which happened
                              in the last few days.

The political conditions in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a></span> have not changed a lot. The parliament is closed, the 
                              delegation is still consulting about the issues concerning both countries. Nothing
                              important results from the delegations’ consultation. Both the Austrian and the Hungarian
                              delegation mostly talk about domestic politics 
                              and barely touch upon foreign politics. Even when consulting about the military, military
                              questions are barely tended to. However, in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> it is discussed whether the 
                              minister of war is in the right: He gave the order that all officers and sergeants
                              need to know the regiment language. Meaning that if a German officer in a regiment
                              mostly of Poles, Ruthenians, Czech, Italians and suchlike, 
                              he has to know Polish or Czech or Italian. Of course, the Poles, Italians, of course
                              are very satisfied with this edict. The Germans, on the other hand, are against it
                              because this impedes the chance of becoming an officer. 
                              Not every German wants to learn another language. The Hungarian delegation also mostly
                              talks about which concessions the minister of war of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> is allowed to make. 
                              He prematurely promises, how one says, heaven and earth. He is talking about new military
                              academies, new schools with Hungarian as the language of instruction, Hungarian officers
                              would only serve in Hungarian regiments 
                              to nurture the Hungarian national pride and suchlike. - But the opposition in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> and in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span>

                              is still not satisfied. As soon as the delegation stops with their punishments and
                              the Imperial Council opens up again, they want to continue their <em>obstruction</em>.
                              </p>

                              Nowadays, the word obstruction has become a very dangerous word in every parliament
                              which they are fearing. By obstructing, just a few delegates can interrupt the entire
                              parliament's work and the parliament cannot do 
                              anything about it. Representatives, who want to obstruct, introduce “emergency motions”
                              daily, which have to be dealt with immediately. They constantly pipe up, hold lengthy
                              speeches and request roll-call votes. This 
                              means they are not voting by raising their hands as usual, but every representative
                              is called up by name and questioned whether they agree or disagree. This type of voting
                              takes up to an hour of time and is done until 
                              the day is over. Therefore, the delegates do not get to consult about the actual subjects
                              which are on the agenda. This is done constantly. However, if the majority wants to
                              pressure the opposition forcefully to end 
                              the filibuster in order to accept a resolution or deal with emergency motions at the
                              end of the session or to use roll-call votes only for important queries, the obstructionists
                              moves on to “vociferous blockage”. They 
                              start to scream, to make noise, to rattle with the lectern, to throw books and bottles,
                              bring fiddles and whistles, play and pipe and squeal until the president has to close
                              the session. Indeed there are parliaments 
                              where there is a way to cope with the obstructionists like in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a></span> or in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place045" target="_blank">France</a></span>. There is a paragraph in the 
                              rules of proceedings by which the president has the right to exclude those who disrupt
                              the meeting for one or more sessions from the parliament. However, in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> 
                              and in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> a paragraph like this does not exist and the president cannot work out a solution
                              with the obstructionists. Moreover, the obstructions in these 
                              countries have endured for a few years already and nobody knows how to solve it. 
                              The parties do not want the president to finally exclude the yellers and noise-makers,
                              every party is anxious to someday obstruct 
                              something. Therefore, they do not want to block themselves already.

                              they want. If it is not resolved 
                              soon, the government will be dissolved. However in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span>, it is not possible to indulge with the Czech as the German do not want to. It is
                              also not possible to 
                              dissolve the government as the end of the filibuster is not known.

                              for over 20 years. This means that both governments agreed to support each other in
                              case another regiment wages war with one of them. If two countries are allied they are meant to be able to live in peace with
                              each 
                              other. This is not the case here. The Italian government conducts itself correctly
                              against <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a></span>, but they are constantly on bad terms, because Emperor

                              20 years ago. However, Emperor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place003" target="_blank">Franz Joseph</a></span> cannot visit the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person047" target="_blank">Italian king</a></span> in the capital <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rome</span> 
                              because the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person035" target="_blank">pope</a></span> lives there as well who does not live peacefully next to the Italian government because
                              they have taken his state! The pope excommunicated 
                              the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person047" target="_blank">Italian king</a></span> and will not welcome a catholic emperor like Emperor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person003" target="_blank">Franz Joseph</a></span> if he visits the

However, he proposed meeting the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person047" target="_blank">Italian king</a></span> in another 
                              city apart from <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place107" target="_blank">Rome</a></span>. But the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person047" target="_blank">Italian king</a></span> does not want that as he does not want to give in to the

Moreover, the relationship between both governments is strained. The current Italian
                              King, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person047" target="_blank">Viktor Emanuel</a></span>, has visited all monarchs, 
                              like the German and Russian emperors, the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person105" target="_blank">English king</a></span> or the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person089" target="_blank">French president</a></span> - just not the 
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person003" target="_blank">Austrian emperor</a></span>. The Italian people show their hostility against <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> openly. The Italians insist on 
                              claiming <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place064" target="_blank">Trieste</a></span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place108" target="_blank">South Tyrol</a></span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place109" target="_blank">Dalmatia</a></span>, and other countries 
                              where Italians reside and unite them with <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place040" target="_blank">Italy</a></span>. Regularly, Italians demonstrate in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span>, Austrian flags are 
                              burnt in the street and the Italian government is just watching. First of all, it
                              is anxious to act against their citizens; secondly, it also agrees with their people
                              a bit, because they desire <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place064" target="_blank">Trieste</a></span>

Only if the demonstrations become too intense will the government intervene as they
                              should not act like that against a friend and ally. - The Austrian 
                              government watches the demonstrations calmly but cautiously. Nobody knows how this
                              will evolve.

                              up voluntary states in order to potentially

Over half of its battleships have been destroyed, the military’s

                              they have lost their desire for war and everything seems like torture. The police
                              in the country force the people to organise patriotic demonstrations, to yell “Hurray”,
                              and are reporting on various misinformation about Russian victories although nobody

Merely the Slavic

                              defeat. They are organising liturgies and pray to God to help the Russian military.
                              But you can tell they are only doing it as a formality. Secretly, they are delighted

                              have already 100,000 men there and are able to go into battle with the Russian army

                              The most important Japanese victory is the destruction of the Manchurian train tracks.
                              The connection between the Russian military is therefore cut off. One part has no

                              are kept in secret and it is not known where they are stationed. Any time, the Japanese

Every third soldier of every regiment is
                              being sent to the battle zone. Russian citizens living abroad who are liable to military
                              service are being called back. 
                              Of course, most do not want to go. Several soldiers have also deserted the military
                              and fled over the borders because they do not want to participate in the war. It is
                              understood that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> can lose their corps as they

                              On the contrary, the Japanese enthusiasm for the war is high. Every imperial prince

                              Whether or not these reports are sincere cannot be answered yet. Fact is, the reforms
                              which were hoped to be introduced in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place081" target="_blank">Macedonia</a></span> were not introduced. Macedonians are not happy with those reformation, 
                              the improvements are <em>not enough</em>. For Albanians (a savage Turkish tribe living in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place081" target="_blank">Macedonia</a></span>) the reforms are too <em>much</em>. They claim that the Turkish government 
                              indulges the revolutionaries way too much. And because they are aware that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a></span> has to give in because of the forces who demand the reforms they want take matters
                              into their own hands. They are attacking 
                              the Macedonians; they steal, murder, and plunder as much as they are able to. The

But now as it is becoming warmer in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place081" target="_blank">Macedonia</a></span> and the snow is starting to melt, Albanians 
                              are also getting started again. Several places report pillaging against Macedonians.
                              Of course, they also do not want to keep silent. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place112" target="_blank">Bulgaria</a></span> wants to intervene and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a></span>,

                              their mind. Bulgarians are aware of their dark end and want to stop scampering. The

In a small town in the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place126" target="_blank">Płock</a></span> province, farmers wanted to destroy the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1362588" target="_blank">Eruv</a> 
                              which Jewish people built to spend Shabbat there. Jewish people there stood in the
                              farmers’ way and some were beaten. Therefore, the Jews filed a suit but the judges
                              wanted to release the farmers which led to a protest. Nobody was invited to speak
                              
                              and in the end the farmers were exculpated. The Jewish lawyer wanted to object, but
                              the court told him to wait until the verdict was sent to him. After some weeks the
                              lawyer still has not received the verdict and turned to the court. The court told
                              him that the 
                              verdict has long been spoken already and filed and it is therefore too late to appeal.
                              The lawyer then handed in an appeal to the senate. We are very curious whether we
                              can count on a Russian court but currently duplicity and 
                              antisemitism dominates the courts.

                              higher classes now as well. For a long time already, people have appealed to the government
                              to create a law against immigration which would hamper Jewish people to immigrate
                              to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place011" target="_blank">England</a></span>. The government did not 
                              want to introduce such a law, because a free country like <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place011" target="_blank">England</a></span> does not want to exhibit antisemitism. - However, the government gave in now. A law
                              was presented in parliament according to which every foreigner 
                              who wants to settle in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place011" target="_blank">England</a></span> needs to possess a passport and a <em>Moralitätszeugnis</em> - a testimonial for moral behaviour. The following three years they are then under
                              supervision of the 
                              police which should immediately deport if any wrongdoings take place. Only after five
                              years are they able to become a citizen. The government can also decide on one place
                              where immigrants should live together. - All of these clauses are directed 
                              against Jewish people. Unfortunate Jews are persecuted like this in the whole world.

On <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">December 17th</span>, a horrible disaster befell the Jewish 
                              community in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place098" target="_blank">Settat</a></span>. The Jewish community, about 7,500 souls, mostly artisans and peddlers fell into
                              misery after a sudden attack. The Jewish people were praying in the synagogue when
                              a heap of 
                              “<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q648255" target="_blank">Kabyle people</a>” (wild Arabs) came riding on horses and destroyed the Jewish quarters. They plundered
                              and demolished whatever they could and took several women and children captive. Two
                              Jews have been trampled 
                              to death, children and women have been horribly beaten and tormented. Caretakers and
                              their children have been ripped out of their beds and been thrown onto the streets.
                              Over 200 houses have been destroyed. Bread and other foods have been stolen almost
                              everywhere. 
                              The unlucky Jews have fled into all directions; nobody knew where the other one was.
                              Some families found each other only after weeks. The Arabs demand huge ransom for
                              their prisoners. The Arab-family “Oled Harim” showed themselves to be benevolent.
                              They 
                              took in many eloping Jews in their homes. One of them rode out with several families
                              to bring back to the city those who were wandering around. - A big part of the fleeing
                              ones, 700 individuals, fled to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place130" target="_blank">Casablanca</a></span>. -

                              him.

                           <p>
                              Back then, the rabbi used to have a lot of power and influence on their communities,
                              the governments supporting them. Not only Jews, but also Christians used to come and
                              whatever the rabbi’s judgement was, it was accepted. The rabbi could 
                              also punish those who did not want to accept his verdict.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Whenever the rabbi went through the city, he always had an attendant in uniform with
                              a stick going in front of him. Behind him the rabbi and two students, one on each
                              side, followed the attendant - on holidays, two assistants accompanied 
                              him as well - and at the back homeowners followed with big sticks as well as knives
                              and spears under their clothes. In case they were to be attacked by a mob they could
                              defend themselves. During the ruling of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person076" target="_blank">Albert</a></span> 
                              it has been quiet in the country and there was no need to be afraid of the rubble,
                              but it has been custom for his students to accompany the rabbi and it stayed like
                              this. And so also this time, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person042" target="_blank">Rabbi Meir</a></span> went to the monarch with company.

                           <p>
                              A courtier was waiting at the palace’s gate who had waited for <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person042" target="_blank">Meir</a></span> and greeted him with great respect. He led the entourage into an anteroom and the
                              rabbi in a huge hall. 
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person042" target="_blank">Meir</a></span> noticed immediately that the man led him another way than usual. As soon as they
                              entered the room, the court official quickly left the rabbi alone. Suddenly, a door
                              opened 
                              and an unfamiliar man rapidly approached the rabbi asking him “Do you still remember
                              me?”
                              </p>   
                           
                           <p>
                              “Yes, I know you from long ago” - answered the rabbi, “but for a few years now I do
                              not want to know you anymore.”
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>   
                              “Oy, old fool!” said the man irritated. “Do you not know that I have you over a barrel
                              and I can do whatever I want with you? This very day you will know who I am and how
                              I can harm you and your people. You will think of me as long as you 
                              live and you will be aware of what Kempe can do. Kneel and bow before me. If you do
                              not want to do it today out of free will, you will have to do it tomorrow by force.
                              - In the past I stood before you with humbleness and respect but now 
                              the tables have turned for you to know what I can do”.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>

But he kept calm and said “For God I may kneel and bow, God
                              can do with me whatever He 
                              wants. I stand before His judgement and I receive His love. - But you? You who left me, your people, and your faith; I will
                              neither bow nor kneel in front of you, even if you kill me. I am not afraid of you.
                              Do you think I do not know how 
                              you want to harm me and my people? I know exactly how you have risen like <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q650680" target="_blank">Haman</a> to destroy me and my people. But you should know that you are not the first one who
                              has done so and has 
                              become enemies with their father and mother, their brothers and the end of the villain
                              was also their end. The world will erase you; your legacy will forever be lost. -
                              I do not seek to curse you, only you and your depravity cause your curse, 
                              which will follow you as long as your life".

His eyes turned red like fire and his appearance turned
                              oddly wild. He yelled: “Just you wait, I will take vengeance on you and your people.
                              I will drink your 
                              blood and will take out all of my evil heart on you. Now go wherever you want to.
                              Your path leads you to death.”

The rabbi was ashamed to hear all of that, but he let him,
                              and knocked on a door which led to the princely hall. The door opened, the clerk came
                              in and Kempe quickly vanished.
