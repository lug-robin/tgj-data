               The Geniuine Jew is a Newspaper that was published from February to November 1904 in Lviv, at that time part of Poland, now in the Ukraine. The aim of this project is
               to translate that paper, give more context about the people and places mentioned, and make this source more accessible to those who do not understand the Yiddish
               language. 
               <lb/>The text is structured in paragraphs as seen in the facsimile - not line per line as the syntax of English and the syntax of Yiddish differs greatly. Highlighted people
               and places are indexed.
