            <p> Out of all Jewish holidays, <ref type="information"
                  source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180115">Purim</ref> is the only one where
               Jews celebrate in remembrance of taking revenge on their enemies. The idea of
               vengeance is admittedly foreign to the Jewish people, as it is explicitly in the holy
               Thora: “You shall not take revenge and you shall not bear a grudge!” But against <ref
                  source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q372091">Amalek</ref> and his children, who
               want to destroy the Jewish people, against enemies like that is the thought of
               vengeance, of revenge permitted. The positive commandment: “Remember what Amalek did
               to you.” delays “You shall not take revenge and you shall not bear a grudge!” for
               now. </p>
            <p> The children of Amalek are still alive to this day. “In every generation, they rise
               up against us to destroy us ( בכל דור ודור קמים עלינו לכלותינו" (Bechol Dor V'Dor
               Kamim Aleinu L'cholotenu))”, in every generation they rise up against us in order to
               destroy us, but “והקב״ה מצילנו מידם" (V'ha'Kadosh Baruch Hu Motzi'lenu Meyadem), God
               saves us from their hands. In His great revenge, we are not responsible, but they are
               avenged upon by another hand in the end. </p>
            <p>Lately, Russia plays the role of Amalek. In <rs type="place"><ref source="place014"
                     >Russia</ref></rs>, Jewish people are pursued the most, they are prosecuted
               most, they are tormented. The whole world was shocked by the horrible acts of
               violence against Jews in <rs type="place"><ref source="place015">Chișinău</ref></rs>.
               Brutality on this level has not happened for hundreds of years, but God, blessed be
               He: “Pull long and pay little”. As a proverb describes: Because Russia thinks it can
               do whatever it wants without agitating anything, the same Russia will see its end
               because of Japan. Every day, new messages arrive of the Russian defeat and the
               Japanese victories, it is truly the downfall of Hama. ( ממש מפּלת המן" (Memesh Miflat
               Haman). For Russia, also this quote will come true: “As you begin to fall, so shall
               you fall. (תּפּול" (K'asher ha'halot l'napol ken nafol tifol). As you begin to fall,
               so <cb/>you shall fall! Russia is being deserted from all sides, all its Asian
               neighbours, which used to ally with Russia - Korea, China, Tibet, and others - turned
               away. They are also looking forward to Russia’s losses and allied with Japan. The
               public opinion is also against Russia, looking forward to its defeat. </p>
            <p>Especially Jews in the whole world rejoice. News in <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place008">America</ref></rs> reports that the local Jews want to buy a
               battleship with all supplies needed, cannons, gunpowder, and so on. They want to name
               it “Chișinău” and gift it to Japan. We do not know if this news is true, but it might
               as well be. “זכור את אשר עשה לך עמלק” (Remember what Amalek did to you) - we always
               have to remember this verse, we cannot forget the persecutions of <rs type="place"
                     ><ref source="place015">Chișinău</ref></rs>, not until Russia meets its end.
               Just like Spain, which once was the biggest empire and these days it pummeled and
               lost its standing. Our friendship with Japan is not מאהבת מרדכי (A friendship to
               Mordechai), because we do not converse with Japan at all. The Japanese are completely
               foreign to us and we have never been in contact with each other, except the same
               hatred of Haman. Our resentment against Russia makes Japan and us friends. We want
               Japan to triumph and therefore Russia should fall. The whole world will be convinced
               that there is a God who cares about the persecuted and punishes the persecutor. Then
               when Russia is like Haman, sad and cowering, then there will be light, and gladness,
               and joy, and honor for the Jews.</p>

            <p>Austrian’s <rs type="place"><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs> Politics have
               been talked about a lot again lately; about which side <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place001">Austria-Hungary</ref></rs> will take in case a war between
                  <rs type="place"><ref source="075">Turkey</ref></rs> and <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place112">Bulgaria</ref></rs> breaks out. That question is not new.
               This question has been talked and written about for hundreds of years. Earlier,
               before <rs type="place"><ref source="place010">Germany</ref></rs> and <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place040">Italy</ref></rs> had been one great empire,
               but several small countries and kingdoms which did not live in peace, the Austrian
               agenda was mainly about intervening in their affairs and increasing the Austrian’s
               influence. From 1866 onwards, after the war between <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> and <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place139">Prussia</ref></rs> with <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place040">Italy</ref></rs>, <rs type="place"><ref source="place025"
                     >Austria</ref></rs> had to renounce any influence it could have had in the
               united <rs type="place"><ref source="place010">Germany</ref></rs> and <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place040">Italy</ref></rs>. From then on, <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> had two great, strong
               neighbours and has to be satisfied with being able to do what it can do alone. But
               now, <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs>’s foreign politics
               can concentrate on <rs type="place"><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs> politics
               again like it did in earlier centuries with its empire and <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place075">Turkey</ref></rs>. It is in the nature of every great empire
               to desire to increase their influence and greaten its borders. The grand global
               powers like <rs type="place"><ref source="place011">England</ref></rs>, <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place045">France</ref></rs>, <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place010">Germany</ref></rs>, and <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place008">America</ref></rs> strive towards conquering new countries in
               other parts of the world like <rs type="place"><ref source="place024">Asia</ref></rs>
               and <rs type="place"><ref source="place137">Africa</ref></rs>. Small <rs type="place"
                     ><ref source="place040">Italy</ref></rs> has won several oversea territories in
                  <rs type="place"><ref source="place137">Africa</ref></rs>, even though it was done
               under great strain and with hardly any benefits. <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> is broadening their borders into Asia and
               if <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> is not hindered by Japan
               in the current war, <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> wants
               to become the main power of <rs type="place"><ref source="place024"
               >Asia</ref></rs>.</p>
            <p>However, <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs>, because of their
               geographical position, is not able to conquer other parts of the world. There are no
               pathways with the oceans and prepared to even do so. <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> can also not take anything from its
               neighbours, the great powers of <rs type="place"><ref source="place014"
                  >Russia</ref></rs>, <rs type="place"><ref source="place010">Germany</ref></rs>,
               and <rs type="place"><ref source="place040">Italy</ref></rs>. What remains is that
               part of the world: the small <rs type="place"><ref source="place077"
                  >Balkan</ref></rs> countries: <rs type="place"><ref source="place066"
                     >Romania</ref></rs>, <rs type="place"><ref source="place112"
                  >Bulgaria</ref></rs>, <rs type="place"><ref source="place111">Serbia</ref></rs>,
               and <rs type="place"><ref source="place080">Montenegro</ref></rs> as well as old,
               weak <rs type="place"><ref source="place075">Turkey</ref></rs>. <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> wanted to take some of <rs type="place"
                     ><ref source="place075">Turkey</ref></rs> for itself wasn’t it for the other
               great powers standing in the way.</p>
            <p>Now, Austrian politics addresses the <rs type="place"><ref source="place077"
                     >Balkan</ref></rs> in depth once again. But not only the other powers stand in
               its way, also some of its own people are against it. The Germans do not want <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> to have any more slaves
               (Peoples on the <rs type="place"><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs> are mostly
               slaves), as <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> would become a
               Slavic state causing the German influence to weaken. Hungarians are against it for
               the same reason, because they are scared of the slaves. Hungarians would prefer <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> to take <rs type="place"
                     ><ref source="place076">Poland</ref></rs> away from <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place014">Russia</ref></rs>. First, they could take revenge on <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> which helped suppress them
               in 1848. Second, the new Slavs <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> would gain come from the Austrian side, not the Hungarian one,
               like the <rs type="place"><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs> countries.</p>
            <p>Having said the truth, Austrian politics might want to desire more of <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place076">Poland</ref></rs> - however, <rs type="place"
                     ><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> is big and strong and is not to be
               messed with and <cb/>what remains is the <rs type="place"><ref source="place077"
                     >Balkan</ref></rs>. And now, <rs type="place"><ref source="place025"
                     >Austria</ref></rs> almost managed to win some land there. After the
               <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q174205">Russo-Turkish war of 1877</ref>, <rs type="place"><ref source="place025"
                  >Austria</ref></rs> got the approval of the <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q151423">Berlin Congress</ref> to occupy two Turkish
               lands with its military for an undisclosed amount of time: <rs type="place"><ref source="place142">Bosnia</ref></rs> and <rs type="plcae"><ref source="place143">Herzegovina</ref></rs>.
               Ostensibly, both countries remain Turkish, but <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> is occupying both to establish order
               there. <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs>, always the holder
               of the Slavic peoples, agreed to this, because <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> already agreed to <rs type="place"><ref
                        source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> gaining <rs type="place"><ref source="place142">Bosnia</ref></rs>-<rs type="place"><ref source="place143">Herzegovina</ref></rs> before the war
               so <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> would not interfere in
               the war.</p>
            <p>However later on, <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> regretted
               this whole thing: It realised that <rs type="place"><ref source="place014"
                     >Russia</ref></rs> had gained nothing in the war while investing huge amounts
               of money into people. Meanwhile, <rs type="place"><ref source="place025"
                     >Austria</ref></rs>, which did nothing at all, gained two countries. <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> started to hold resentment
               against <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> and watched <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> as well as paid close
               attention to the countries on the <rs type="place"><ref source="place077"
                     >Balkan</ref></rs>. <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs>
               should not be able to gain any more land. </p>
            <p>To be clear, <rs type="place"><ref source="place142">Bosnia</ref></rs> and <rs type="place"><ref source="place143">Herzegovina</ref></rs> is not enough for <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place025">Austria</ref></rs>. These are two poor countries which only
               need to receive money. <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs>
               also desires <rs type="place"><ref source="place081">Macedonia</ref></rs> with the port city <rs type="place"><ref source="place144">Thessaloniki</ref></rs>. If <rs type="place"><ref
                  source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> took <rs type="place"><ref source="place144">Thessaloniki</ref></rs> in possession, it would
               gain access to the <rs type="place"><ref source="place141">Black Sea</ref></rs>, expand its trade and increase influence. But <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> stood in its path. Besides,
               Austrian politics sufficed to pay attention to the condition in the <rs type="place"
                     ><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs> countries to stay as they are. That
               means, several small, but weak countries as to harm <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> should remain like this
               for a for years. Both <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> and
                  <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> strive to gain
               influence there. <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> has the
               biggest authority in <rs type="place"><ref source="place145">Armenia</ref></rs>, <rs type="place"><ref source="place014"
                  >Russia</ref></rs> in <rs type="place"><ref source="place080">Montenegro</ref></rs>; the tables have turned in <rs type="place"><ref source="place112">Bulgaria</ref></rs> and <rs type="place"><ref source="place111">Serbia</ref></rs>.
               Some time <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> had more to say,
               some time <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> had more to say.
               Lately, both realised the great disorder prevailing in the <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs> countries. Every country does whatever they
               want as they are either reliant on <rs type="place"><ref source="place025"
                     >Austria</ref></rs> or <rs type="place"><ref source="place014"
                  >Russia</ref></rs>. Furthermore, both countries agreed to keep order and kept the
                  <rs type="place"><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs> countries to wage war
               with <rs type="place"><ref source="place075">Turkey</ref></rs> because of <rs type="place"><ref source="place081">Macedonia</ref></rs>.
               However, <rs type="place"><ref source="place075">Turkey</ref></rs> demanded to
               introduce reforms in Macedonia to reassure the Macedonians.</p>
            <p>The Turkish, the <rs type="place"><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs> countries,
               the Macedonians - until now they all had to stay quiet. But now, as <rs type="place"
                     ><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs>’s hands are tied in <rs type="place"
                     ><ref source="place024">Asia</ref></rs> because of the war with <rs type="place"><ref source="place019">Japan</ref></rs>, they are
               starting to bestir again. <rs type="place"><ref source="place075">Turkey</ref></rs>
               gathered a lot of military, <rs type="place"><ref source="place112">Bulgaria</ref></rs> is getting ready for war, and the Macedonians
               are restarting their revolution again. </p>
            <p>And now the question remains: What will <rs type="place"><ref source="place025"
                     >Austria</ref></rs> do? - Voices multilaterally claim that <rs type="place"
                     ><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs>, which was not even afraid of <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs>, will take the chance to
               occupy <rs type="place"><ref source="place081">Macedonia</ref></rs> and <rs type="place"><ref source="place144">Thessaloniki</ref></rs>. The Austrian government denies these allegations,
               mostly because it does not want to start off badly with <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place040">Italy</ref></rs>. Namely because <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place040">Italy</ref></rs> has also started to mingle in the <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs> affairs. It desires <rs type="place"><ref source="place146">Albania</ref></rs>.
                  <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> on the other hand
               dislikes these schemes, because it does not want <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place040">Italy</ref></rs> to be its neighbour on all sides. But
               the<pb/></p>
            <p style="text-align:center" rend="bold">[2]</p>
            <p><rs type="person"><ref source="person060">king</ref> of <rs type="place"><ref source="place040">Italy</ref></rs></rs> is the
               son-in-law of a Montenegrin prince and sees itself as a big part of the families of
               the <rs type="place"><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs>.</p>
            <p>In the end, it comes down to this: if a war breaks out on the <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs>, then <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> is going to use that opportunity to march
               into <rs type="place"><ref source="place081">Macedonia</ref></rs> with its military. It is going to occupy <rs type="place"><ref source="place111">Serbia</ref></rs> as well and <rs type="person"><ref source="person036">King Peter</ref></rs>
               will sit weak and alone on his throne, not being able to do anything. <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> will be indignant, but will
               also have to keep quiet temporarily. Only <rs type="place"><ref source="place075"
                     >Turkey</ref></rs>’s and <rs type="place"><ref source="place040"
                  >Italy</ref></rs>’s reactions are still unclear: Whether they are going to war
               with <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> or they want to
               reconcile with each other in peace. In any case, one thing is for sure: If war breaks
               out on the <rs type="place"><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs>, <rs
                  type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> will have to intervene.</p>
