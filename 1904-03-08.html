                              a week, to please send money to add to their subscription according to the current
                              price of the newspaper. For those who do not 
                              remargin, we will deduct the difference from their current subscription. This means
                              those who subscribed for half a year will receive the paper for only four months.
                              The same applies to yearly and quarterly subscribers.

                              Justice has won again. The truth can not be suppressed forever, but has to surface
                              like oil on water. It is possible that the falsehood, the lie, can win for a short
                              time, but later the truth has to come to light.

                           <p>
                              We saw that happening during the Dreyfus trials. It is horrible to think about the
                              heap of lies and duplicity which the French generals pinned on poor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person082" target="_blank">Dreyfus</a></span>, just because he 
                              is Jewish. After hundreds of years the world will think the story of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person082" target="_blank">Dreyfus</a></span> to be a fairy tale which is a preposterous lie. Nobody will believe that something
                              
                              like this is even possible! - A lot has been written about it, but it is still not
                              the whole story. Deceptions and lies that have not been uncovered yet are still present.
                              Who knows how long it will take to uncover the whole truth.
                              All of the general staff, a lot of foreign officers, ambassadors, envoys, and attachées
                              (foreign representatives at the French government) intermeddled in the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q173457" target="_blank">Dreyfus-affair</a>. 
                              Men in high and important positions, who call the shots in all important matters of
                              the land, the most important issues in politics, in war and in peace - those men were
                              not ashamed to contribute in the prosecution of a single man, 
                              a Jewish officer. Nobody knew him, nobody was interested in him, he could have lived
                              a hundred years and nobody would have taken notice of him. - that is how great the
                              power of deception is; of lies, of violence, of persecution 
                              and of antisemitism. However, the truth, justice has come out on top. The truth shall
                              spring out of the earth. Neither the efforts of French generals, nor those of the
                              ministers or the people have helped - poor

                              they worked as long as it was necessary to convince the French people that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person082" target="_blank">Dreyfus</a></span> is innocent.

                              The French people, the parliament, the senate, the supreme court thought that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person082" target="_blank">Dreyfus</a></span> was innocent, but the antisemitic generals did not want to drop off, they did not
                              want to admit the truth. 
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person082" target="_blank">Dreyfus</a></span> came back, he was put on trial a second time. Publically, in front of the whole world,
                              he defended himself, proved that he was innocent. The military court however did not
                              want to relent 
                              and convicted him again. By then, the government could not stay quiet anymore, it
                              could not stand aside anymore. The French president <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person089" target="_blank"><em>Loubet</em></a></span> <em>pardoned</em> and released him.

Pardoned - that means: he is indeed
                              guilty, but he was remitted the penalty. He wants to prove that he is <em>not guilty</em>, 
                              he does not need to be pardoned. He demands <em>justice</em>. It took a long time until he achieved this because according to the law, a new fact
                              which the previous court did not know about, had to be detected. Therefore, a new
                              trial 
                              had to commence, but in the end not one, but several more facts were found. It was
                              found out that general <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person090" target="_blank">Paty de Clam</a></span>, who led the trial against <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person082" target="_blank">Dreyfus</a></span>, 
                              kept all documents which proved <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person082" target="_blank">Dreyfus</a></span>’ innocence and did not show them to the court. And so, the Supreme court took matters
                              into its hands, initiated a lengthy investigation and finally decided 
                              that the whole <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person082" target="_blank">Dreyfus</a></span> trial needs to be revised.

                              To prevent a military court from further obscuring the whole matter and  convicting
                              Dreyfus again, the court ordered that it is forbidden to try him to another military
                              court. Solely the Supreme Court is allowed to carry out the lawsuit. This investigation
                              
                              will last several more months. Every lie, every contortion will be exposed and in

                              We as Jews are particularly interested in the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person082" target="_blank">Dreyfus</a></span> affair because of two things. First, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person082" target="_blank">Dreyfus</a></span> is a <em>Jew</em> and was 
                              prosecuted because of it, because he is a <em>Jew</em> - and second, his story resembles that of the Jewry, which is also persecuted because
                              it is Jewish. - And if we can observe how justice and truth has come out victorious,
                              we 
                              are joyous with hope that there is justice for the Jewish people. The earth will flourish
                              anew, and justice will descend from heaven.

                              to chevy the Jews. It was like this in 1881, after the 
                              <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1494934" target="_blank">nihilistic revolutions</a> when pogroms were happening in every major city. The government achieved two things
                              with these policies: first, the rabble hates the Jews, not the government; 
                              second, the government can satisfy the commotions, introduce martial law and oppress
                              the people once again. - That is also the root for the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Kishinev</a></span> pogrom. The government saw that the 
                              nation had been discontent for some years and the working class was strongly agitated
                              - the government sic the people against the nation immediately.

                              Again, the Russian nation is disturbed. News about the Russian defeat in the war amplified
                              the unrest. The government resorts to old remedies and stirs up hatred against the
                              Jews. It is widely known that the Russian laws are very strict; 
                              every minute political crime is punished severely. If the government wanted to, it
                              could suppress any movement immediately, but instead whenever the mob rises and the
                              government does nothing, it signals its agreement with the persecution 
                              and even helps to foster it.

                              This time, the government chose <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Chișinău</a></span> once again for the persecutions. Reports say that there have been demonstrations
                              against Jews. The mob wandered through the streets in large crowds, 
                              yelled threats against the Jews and broke in the windows of several Jewish houses.
                              Multiple Jewish shops were robbed, some Jewish people were even beat up.

                              I was plainly delighted as I received your Tuesday edition last night. Before, as
                              it was published only once a week, I felt that I was waiting a year for every day
                              until a paper arrives and
                              </p>

                           <p>
                              between the newspapers I waited six years for another one… Still I need to indeed
                              wait three years for the next one… but three is not six… only because of that I give
                              you a piece of advice that you should also do so for the three fake years… 
                              that means you should publish your newspaper daily and that would provide you with
                              three additional real years of means of support - with a daily newspaper you will
                              gain twenty times the number of subscribers, without exaggeration - in my city 
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place209" target="_blank">Sadhora</a></span>, you will gain a lot of subscribers as before other papers written in vernacular
                              have. “<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12405872" target="_blank">Der Fraind</a>”, a paper coming from

If it would take

                              For more than a year already, there has been a conflict in the Hungarian parliament
                              which cannot be resolved. The emperor has already appointed two different ministers
                              twice already and the government has granted the opposition important concessions.
                              
                              As is common knowledge, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> has been separated from <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> and forms a peculiar country. It has its own ministry, a special parliament and completely
                              
                              different laws in every area which concerns the inner state affairs only. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> are bound with a treaty which was concluded in the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209601" target="_blank">Compromise</a> 
                              and needs to be renewed every decade. According to the Compromise, both countries
                              together constitute a joint monarchy which is called <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a></span>. They have a joint military, joined foreign politics 
                              which is led by a joint minister of foreign affairs, and joint tariff legislation
                              with joint trade contracts which means that the customs for foreign merchandise is
                              the same whether it is important in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> 
                              or <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span>. The trade contracts with other countries are being decided together. The foreign
                              politics being jointly executed <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> would have to join 
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> in war and vice versa. However, there is a party in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> which wants the only connection to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> 
                              to be having <em>one</em> emperor. Other than that each country should be a country on its own. Each country
                              should have their own military, their own tax tariffs, trade contracts and the likes
                              of it. The majority of the current Hungarian 
                              population still stands with the government which does not want to split off <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span>. Both countries profit from the mutual cohabitation: First, the monarchy is big and
                              strong and can therefore defend its own 
                              interests like any great power; second, both countries distribute its produce in the
                              other country. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> sends crops and cattle, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> sends its factory 
                              products. Immi- and emigration is freely allowed as to why trade is very common which
                              strengthens the populations wealth. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              As the government proposed the new recruitment plan last year according to which <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""></span> 
                              wanted to raise the military with several thousand men, the Hungarian opposition said
                              that it will take advantage of the opportunity and withhold approval until their demands
                              are met. They want the language of command to be Hungarian instead of German as has
                              been 
                              the case until now. The government denied this request with the following explanation:
                              if Hungarian became the command language the military unity would be disrupted and
                              split into a special Hungarian and a special Austrian military. In case of war they
                              would not 
                              be able to understand each other and cause a disaster. If the government made several
                              smaller concessions regarding the military, the opposition would have been easy to
                              please. However the government (<span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person035" target="_blank">Kálmán <em>Széll</em></a></span> 
                              was the minister president then) explained that it cannot pander to the military demands
                              as only the emperor has the final say in this matter and the government cannot mingle.
                              Furthermore the opposition obstructed the recruitment law. This filibuster lasted
                              several 
                              months during which the government watched calmly until the obstruction got tired
                              and gave up. However the opposition never got tired, the minister president <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place035" target="_blank">Széll</a></span> resigned and Count <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person091" target="_blank">Károly Khuen-Héderváry</a></span> 
                              followed him as minister president. He granted the opposition multiple concessions.
                              For example, Hungarian soldiers should only serve in Hungarian regiments, the inscriptions
                              on Hungarian barracks should only be written in Hungarian and the like. The majority
                              of the 
                              opposition was satisfied and forfeited, but a smaller part  did not want to budge.
                              As the procedural rules of the Hungarian parliament are unrestricted and not parochial,
                              the government could not come to a conclusion with the minority of the opposition.
                              Count 
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person091" target="_blank">Khuen-Héderváry</a></span> resigned from his position and was replaced by <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person005" target="_blank">István Tisza</a></span>, the son of the previous prime minister <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person092" target="_blank">Kálmán Tisza</a></span>.

                           <p>
                              The new minister president also started by making concessions to the opposition to
                              appease them. As the recruitment law was not passed, the military could not be approved
                              and the three year veterans were held back and instead the reserves were conscripted
                              which provoked 
                              dissatisfaction in the whole country. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person005" target="_blank">Tisza</a></span> thought that the opposition would give in easier as the reserves should go back home.
                              But he made a mistake. The small of the opposition continued filibustering and it
                              could not be contained. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Now, Count <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person005" target="_blank">Tisza</a></span> has lost his patience and wants to break the filibuster with force. He made a motion
                              in parliament to change the order of business so that obstruction will not be possible
                              anymore. A fight in the Hungarian 
                              parliament is looming. Now a big part of the deputies who have not been in the opposition
                              </p>

                              are now against changing the order of business as they think of it as an illegality.
                              Therefore, they have joined the filibuster. It will be a difficult battle without
                              an indication who will win.

The way how the Russian government treats Jewish people is illustrated by this

                              If only an officer would have been at the crime scene when the turmoil started, would
                              it have calmed down immediately. It is true that as soon as the police arrived at the square, the mob ran away, but police arrived too late.

                              The court sentenced following defendants: <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Anatoly Falitshuk</span> to five days detention, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Arkady Savak</span> to 14 days, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Alyona Sammattyuk</span> to five days, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Pavel Chaban</span> to four months rigorous imprisonment with one day fast every two weeks,

                              the court fees. The demands for compensation made by the harmed Jews have to be brought
                              to civil court.

In the night from Sunday to Monday, Japanese battleships bombarded the fortress.
                              The Russian ships did not shoot back, because the Japanese ships were too far away
                              and the Japanese cannons can shoot farther than the Russian ones. The Japanese did
                              not do a lot of damage.

                              the Manchurian borders. The Russians retreat.

The Chinese act more and more like double agents. They claim to be neutral, and
                              therefore impartial, but they secretly arm to war and collect a lot of military at
                              the border. As soon as the Japanese win the ground warfare, the Chinese will join
                              the Japanese and declare war on <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span>.
