               It is sad to recount, our hearts hurt and we want to cry when we look around all the corners of Jewish life in <rs type="place"><ref source="place006">Galicia</ref></rs>. We do not find one thing we are happy about. 
               No matter where we look, there is neglect, dereliction, and chaos - it is shocking!
            </p>
            <p>
               The “talmetoyre” belongs to this sad chapter of our life. Talme-Toyre is the greatest commandment for us Jews, “The study of Torah is equivalent to all other commandments combined.”<cb/> our scholars, <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2902413">may their memory be a blessing</ref>
               Our talme-toyre are [<hi rend="italic">more than anything else, heavily neglected</hi>. The more important a commandment is, the bigger we neglect them. The bigger the benefit, the less it is badly administered.
            </p>
            <p>
               We do not need to tell you how important the Talme-Toyre is, every Jew understands that on their own. We are not only referring to learning the <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q930585">Gemara</ref> and <ref source="place">Pirush Hamishnayot</ref> 
               - we are also referring to simply learning the (Hebrew) alphabet, to the reading of Hebrew, about the Torah, how to pray, to understand the meaning of all of that. All the things we cannot imagine a child not knowing about without being very sad, dark, and bitter. 
               The number of children not knowing how to read and write, not knowing the alphabet, who do not know the prayers and lore in the Torah is increasing. The children of rich parents who can afford a tutor, do not suffer as badly, they are still learning something. 
               However, the children of the lower class, the children of which our scholars, may their memory be a blessing, have said: “Beware of the poor, for from them Torah will come.” These children are neglected completely. 
            </p>
            <p>  
               Those who visit school, do not know about the Torah at all. They are being taught religion at school, but do not ask how. However, those children who do not visit a school, do not have a great knowledge. Their parents cannot 
               afford a tutor and without money, they cannot learn a lot.

               It has always been like that poor parents were not able to provide an education. That is why every community founded a talmetoyre where a teacher taught and poor children could learn for free. Nowadays there is a talmetoyre in 
               every community - but in what condition? What do children learn there? What can they do when they finish it? These questions could anyone who has experienced these conditions themselves answer. 
            </p>
            <p>   
               The sad part is that every community agrees on the commandment, a talmetoyre should exist. But they do not want to see the commandment carried out. After renting a school and hiring a teacher they do not bother furthermore. It 
               is not checked if the teacher really learns with the children, if the children go there on a regular basis. If the head of the family sends his children to school, he checks from time to time, goes to school to see if the 
               children go there regularly. But nobody cares for the talmetoyre children. 
            </p>
            <p>
               And it would be so easy to help. In every community with a talmetoyre a committee which should pledge to visit the talmetoyre every once in a while, control whether the teacher teaches as it should be, check if the children 
               are learning something useful. With that the talmetoyre school would be put in order and the teacher would fulfill his duty better. The talmetoyre would become something turned into something needed: an institution constituting 
               a fear of God in our children.

            <p style="text-align:right">The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace!</p>
            <p>
               The war between <rs type="place"><ref source="place019">Japan</ref></rs> and <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> has grabbed the attention of the whole world and is of huge interest for us as we have 
               written in earlier editions. <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> is our biggest enemy and if calamity befalls it, it shall only give us pleasure. Furthermore it is believed that after the war, when 
               <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> has been defeated, it will have to improve the country’s inner organisation. It will have to grant more liberty and stop oppressing the Jews. The small antisemitic 
               countries like <rs type="place"><ref source="place124">Romania</ref></rs> or <rs type="place"><ref source="place097">Morocco</ref></rs> can not refer to <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> to excuse 
               their antisemitism. Until now, the powers did not know about <rs type="place"><ref source="place124">Romania</ref></rs> because it has always pointed out that Jews are being treated badly in big <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> 
               and maybe even worse. If big <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> is allowed to it, small <rs type="place"><ref source="place124">Romania</ref></rs> should also be allowed. After the defeat 
               <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> will firstly<cb/> stop playing a big part and secondly the Jews will be treated better.
            </p>
            <p>
               All of this is only said about the foreign Jews. The foreign should want and should express their joy once <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> <hi rend="italic">fails</hi>. The Austrian antisemites would 
               gather in an assembly and pronounce publicly that those who are antisemitic should pray for <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> to win because <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> 
               is the only antisemitic government in <rs type="place"><ref source="place100">Europe</ref></rs>. They send the Russian ambassador in <rs type="place"><ref source="place007">Vienna</ref></rs> a felicitation and ask him to 
               inform the tsar that he still has friends in the world, the antisemites. Therefore, also the Jewish people should announce to the world that they pray to God, asking for <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs>’s 
               downfall. The tsar should know that Jews all over the world are not his friend and do not wish him kindness. 
            </p>
            <p>
               For the Jews living in <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> it is different. As it is, they are still subjects of the tsar and had to adhere to the laws, the tsar’s orders and his ministers. For them these 
               times are difficult, they are indecisive and do now know what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
               <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs>’s people are agitated and concerned. The Polish, the Finnish, the Armenians, the socialists and all the friends of freedom who have suffered under the Russian burden 
               and were not able to lift their heads, are beginning to move strongly. Until now, there has not been a revolution, it is still too early for this because <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> is still too 
               strong and could squash every revolution. However, the preparations have already begun. All parties have released calls and proclamations which announce that the present situation is very important. Finally, scores can be 
               settled and the tsar will be forced to provide the country with more freedom. However, the proclamations warn the people to not organise demonstrations or revolutions because this will not lead to victory. But those who are 
               able to read between the lines understand that the opposite is meant. They are yelling: “No revolutions!” but they mean: “Prepare for the day the revolution will start. The Russian government is also deeply troubled. At the 
               beginning of the war, the government organised patriotic demonstrations in every bigger city during which the imperial was celebrated and “Hurray” was being yelled. By now, the demonstrations have stopped. The government is 
               afraid that between the patriotic demonstrations there will also be non-patriotic ones. Between those who yell: “Hurray” will be mingled with those who yell “Down with <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs>!” 
               Furthermore, every and any gathering and demonstrations are suppressed. 
            </p>
            <p>
               The Jewish people are confronted with the question: how should we behave in case a revolution breaks out? There are a lot of hot-headed Russian Jews who cannot wait to see <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> 
               fall. It is very likely that they will participate in a revolutionary movement. Generally, Jews are provoked by the government. They will be forced to donate huge sums of money for the means of war. Several big Jewish 
               communities had to donate thousands of rubles. Furthermore, the Jews have not forgotten the <rs type="place"><ref source="place015">Kishinev</ref></rs> trials which is taking place 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:center" rend="bold">[2]</p>
            <p>
               every day at the moment. As this leads to dereliction and them doing whatever they want, some Russian newspapers have the audacity to demand the Jews to forgive and forget everything and instead be Russian patriots who want to 
               sacrifice themselves and their wealth for the fatherland. We found a letter in the <rs type="place"><ref source="place015">Chișinău</ref></rs> paper “Otkliki” in which a “Jew” feels free to write to Russian Jews: “Our brothers, 
               the children of <rs type="place"><ref source="place035">Israel</ref></rs>! We are living in horrible times, sad hours - it is like Yom Kippur! We have to forget everything, we should only have one thing in mind: <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> 
               is in danger! We need to prove ourselves as true children of our fatherland, as true followers of the morality of our holy Torah. A severe calamity has befallen our fatherland, a horrible war! Should we not march together with 
               our Russian brothers? Should we not share all of the war’s consequences with our Russian brothers? Every one of us should donate to their possibilities for war purposes. Let us show them that we are worth being seen and treated 
               as brothers of the big Russian people!”
            </p>
            <p>
               Of course, effronteries like this irritates the Jewish people even more, especially when the government treats us so cruelly. Only in the last couple of days, Jews have been banished from <rs type="place"><ref source="place178">Siberia</ref></rs>, 
               driven out of <rs type="place"><ref source="place151">Moscow</ref></rs>; several Jews have been arrested in <rs type="place"><ref source="place187">Kyiv</ref></rs>, <rs type="place"><ref source="place033">Warsaw</ref></rs>, and 
               <rs type="place"><ref source="place188">Łódź</ref></rs>, some Jews have been hanged in the <rs type="place"><ref source="place033">Warsaw</ref></rs> citadel because they wanted to desert the military. Treating Jewish people as 
               horrible and cruel and simultaneously demand patriotism and sacrifices - this already oversteps every possible mark for the calmest person to lose their temper. 
            </p>
            <p>
               But despite it all, the Russian Jews need to stay calm and not be tempted to revolt. Jewish people alone will not accomplish anything, because they are too weak and dispersed over various districts. They do not form one uniformly 
               organised mass and can not win themselves alone. However, if they join other revolutionaries, they will throw the baby out with the bathwater. Whatever way the revolution will end, there will be no benefit for the Jewish people. 
               History has taught us that everyone who utilises Jewish support and therefore comes to power and influence will sooner or later forget the Jews once they are not needed anymore. We already saw that in 1848 and on other occasions 
               as well. The only right thing for Jewish people to do is to keep calm, to not be goaded or upset. They do not need to be patriotic because <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> does not deserve that, they do 
               not need to overexert themselves and donate money if they are not being forced to do so. On the other hand, they also do not need to be revolutionaries. “What’s lost is lost!” <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> 
               will fall into other hands, the war will end it, it will fall down and down until the lowest level. God will wage war for you and you should remain silent!

            <head style="text-align:center"><hi rend="bold">Letter from <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs>.</hi></head>
         <p>   
            Apart from <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs>, <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs> is the only other country where Jews suffer from laws of exceptional character, which means they are not 
            equal to any other citizen, but those laws have been issued especially for Jewish people who suffer greatly. In some cases the situation for Romanian Jews is worse than for Russian Jews. <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs> 
            is an illiberal ruled country, which oppresses its whole citizenship, Jew or not. The Polish, the Armenians, the Finish are being particularly persecuted. If Jewish people suffer more than everyone else, but if the government improves, 
            the situation for Jews will as well. 
         </p>
         <p>
            However, <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs> is a free country with a constitution; the level of freedom is great, as Romanians proclaim proudly; the French of the <rs type="place"><ref source="place077">Balkan</ref></rs>. 
            They have a parliament, free press, freedom of thought and similar laws as in every European country. However, the 350,000 Jews living there are being oppressed and persecuted. Every citizen lives freely and unrestricted, only the Jewish 
            people live in fear and fright. Their situation is bitter and the hatred towards them great.
         </p>
         <p>
            Still, one should not assume that exceptional laws exist in the free country of <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs>. No! That does not match with a civilised land. Furthermore, the <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1048169">Berlin congress in 1848</ref> 
            only allowed <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs> to be an independent country if the Jewish people were given the same laws as all citizens of the country. The Romanian laws do not mention the word “Jew”. The smart 
            Romanians speculated by putting in the word “foreign” instead of “Jew”. Every citizen in <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs> abides by the same laws, except for “foreigners” - and “foreigners” translate to “Jews”. 
            Although they are born in the country like their parents and grandparents, served in the military, bear the weight of the country as everyone else - but they are still “foreigners” - and “foreigners” do not have any rights in 
            <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs>. Foreigners are not allowed to live in villages, foreigners are not allowed to supply the government, foreigners are not allowed to be lawyers, pharmacists, or labourers 
            because whoever owns a bigger factory has to employ primarily domestic workers and not “foreigners”. The Romanian Jews are “foreigners” in <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs>, but they do not have another 
            home as they are indeed Romanians. Nobody attends to them, nobody cares about them. The great powers who signed the Treaty of <rs type="place"><ref source="place031">Berlin</ref></rs> protested a few times against this poor treatment 
            of Jews, but <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs> ignored that and remained silent. The powers on their side do not bother intermingling with the country’s “inner” affairs because of the Jewish people - they are 
            still only <hi rend="italic">Jews</hi> after all. 
         </p>
         <p>
            The reason why Jewish people are being treated so poorly in <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs> - a country being governed so freely and liberally - is the following: the Romanian people consist mostly of farmers 
            and are not very intelligent. The ministers, the generals, the high officials and the deputies
         </p>
            <p style="text-align:center" rend="bold">[3]</p>
            <p>
               of parliament are mostly immigrated Greeks and Bulgarians who exploits the Romanian people and control it however they want because they are afraid that the Romanian people should not wake up and let themselves be exploited by other 
               external forces as they want to keep <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs> in darkness and fear as it always is with the <hi rend="italic">Jews</hi>. The Jew is an exploiter, a fraud, he does not work and lives 
               off the hard work of the Romanian people - that is what they yell regularly so the people do not notice they are being skinned by their own representatives. - The Romanian people are naturally indulgent and lived well alongside the 
               Jews, only the foreign exploiters set the people against the Jewish people. 
            </p>
            <p>   
               Moreover, there are two parties in <rs type="place"><ref source="place068">Romania</ref></rs> after all: liberal and conservative. Both fight each other and every now and then another party comes into power. Every party wants to show the 
               people that they are better and as the country is poor and it is hardly possible to create something new, they all want to pass more laws against the Jewish people. With that it can show the nation: “Look! We protect you against the Jewish 
               exploiters!” They talk the farmers into believing that if they take the piece of bread away from the Jew, the farmer will be better off. 
            </p>
            <p>   
               The Romanian Jews are of course tired of suffering from all these persecutions, in the end they emigrate. Whenever times are bad in the country, hundreds of families emigrate at once. Everyone will remember the sad memories which were made 
               three years ago as the Romanian emigrants walk hundreds of miles or they are put into separate wagons like criminals, as they roamed around in every bigger city and aroused pity on their whole world with their sad state. Back then the 
               Romanian government was ashamed of their actions and started to deter the Jews from emigrating. They made it more difficult to obtain passports and to cross the border. They also promised to ease the exemption laws under which the 
               Romanian Jews were living. - But as soon as emigration steadied, the persecution and oppression of Jews commenced to happen like before. Because of the laws of exemption under which the Jews are suffering from, the Jewry is suffering 
               as well. As the Jewish people there are viewed as “foreigners” the government does not recognise their municipalities and communities. The rabbis have no say and no influence, schools have also been closed down on multiple occasions as 
               “foreigners” are not allowed to operate schools… The government has promised several times to improve the situation and to introduce an organisation for the community - but as usual, it does not keep its word.

            <p>
               The second trial regarding the cruel pogrom which happened last year started these days in <rs type="place"><ref source="place015">Chișinău</ref></rs>. Like last time, the process was a sheer comedy. Out of 59 defendants who have been accused of 
               killing Jews, 56 have been acquitted and only three have been charged namely one of them to one<cb/> year and two to four and a half years of penal servitude. In <rs type="place"><ref source="place014">Russia</ref></rs>, where the smallest crime 
               is punished harshly, murdering a Jew gets punished by one year of detention…
            </p>
            <p>
               The whole trial played out the way the <rs type="place"><ref type="place018">St Petersburg</ref></rs> government dictated the chief justice <hi rend="italic"><rs type="person">Davidov</rs></hi> to do. The judge attempts to cover up the truth with great effort. Under no 
               circumstances should be revealed who the instigator was. The government and officials suppress and persecute Jews severely to the degree of wanting to gloss over the whole affair and not wanting to be bothered by it anymore. 
            </p>
            <p>
               One of the exonerees, a certain <rs type="person">Korkhov</rs>, has been accused by multiple witnesses who saw him alone murder the Jew <rs type="person">Ulman</rs> and desecrate the body afterwards. He still got acquitted. 
            </p>
            <p>
               On February 25th, the trial against the brothers <rs type="person">Petersko</rs>, who murdered two Jews and battered one to put him into hospital for three months on April 20th in the middle of the day in the <rs type="place"><ref source="place188">Kiever Gasse</ref></rs>, 
               took place. Fifteen witnesses swore to have seen it all. Still, they were sentenced to only four years of penal servitude. 
            </p>
            <p>
               On February 26th, the third trial started, dealing with 50 accused. The trial will certainly end like the trials so far.

               <rs type="place"><ref source="place148">Kolomyia</ref></rs>. The trials about the <rs type="place"><ref source="place147">Zabolotiv</ref></rs> pogroms have already lasted a whole week. Most witnesses confirm  the accusations. It becomes apparent that the persecutions were not systematically planned, but that the 
               people had been intensely incited by antisemites. It had been sufficient that one person started to cry against the Jews that everyone joined and believed what was said. Several more witnesses will be summoned to court and the trial will take another whole week.

               (<rs type="place"><ref source="place194">Pomorjany</ref></rs>). A Jew from <rs type="place"><ref source="place195">Dynów</ref></rs> who has recently passed our city, has asked his waggoner something in Polish in the middle of the central plaza. A Ruthanian farmer who heard 
               this by chance attacked the Jew in outrage and yelled: “Cursed Jew! Lives on Ruthanian soil, eats Ruthanian bread, and speaks Polish!” He started to beat the Jew with a big stick, who could barely escape. - The Jews do not know what to do anymore, how they should speak; 
               everything is bad. The Polish yell at them that they are German because they speak Yiddish which is similar to German.
