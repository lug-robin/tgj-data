            <head>Our religious education</head>
            <p>“One could almost laugh about it, if it wasn’t so sad”... We can justifiably use this general idiom in regards to the religious education at our public schools when accusing our advanced Jewish people 
               that our religious education is substantially neglected. Our children grow up without a Jewish consciousness concerning religion and faith, they do not know anything about the Jewry, about Jewish celebrations, 
               or about Jewish music. The educated Jewry then points to the religious education in the schools, that a religious educator is employed in every school who is paid by the Jewish community, that a representative 
               of the Jewish community sits in the local education authority, that according to the law the religious education is crucial in education. A student might be perfectly educated, but if he doesn’t know about 
               religion he will not pass the exam - because of all of that they know that the religious education is esteemed and highly renowned and everything is to be done in order to educate the children religiously. 
            </p>
            <p>All of those responses are correct. We have religious educators in every school - but nobody asks what kind of educators they are? We have representatives in the local education authorities, but nobody asks 
               how concerned they are with our religious inquiries? - The Jewish communities pay the teacher, but nobody asks how they care about the religious education? - The religious education is a significant subject 
               for every Jewish pupil, but nobody asks if it really happened that a Jewish student <pb/>failed an exam because he didn’t know anything about religion?
            </p>
            <p>
               The answer is: religious education in schools is a serious subject, but is not taught seriously. We don’t want to use a harsher expression, otherwise we would have to say: it is treated like a joke.
            </p>
            <p>
               The religious educator is for the most part not really pious. The children realise that he thinks little of religion and what he teaches. Therefore, the religious education doesn’t leave a big impression, 
               they don’t take it seriously and take religion solely as a story, which they don’t have to know anything about, like other historical chronicles. There isn’t really an alternative; for the most part they 
               are in school ignoring the Sabbath to learn writing, calculating and similar - how should they think about the Sabbath as honourable? And if the religious educator is a serious man, as those educators really 
               are, then he has a serious challenge with children of non-pious parents. For example, if he learns in school that eating <ref source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chametz">Chametz</ref> is not allowed during 
               <ref source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover">Passover</ref> - and that child goes home and eats Chametz , then goes back to school and explains that the teacher lied about Chametz  not being  forbidden 
               to eat .The same happens with the Sabbath observance and other big customs of the Jewish religion.
            </p>
            <p>
               But if a teacher who wants to take a stance against that and wants to convince the children that the religion he teaches is the true Jewry - then a fight against him rises. He gets reported to the Local 
               Education Administration, an investigation against him gets instigated and he is <pb/> being assaulted until he shuts up and is quiet.                
            </p>
            <p>
               However, a Jewish representative sits in the Local Education Administration, who should take on the teacher, because doesn’t he sit there for exactly that reason? You will of course ask, but that is indeed a bad 
               thing. The Jewish school inspector wants to demonstrate that he is a modern man, not a fanatic and only cares about the religion teacher if pious parents complain that the lessons are bad. But he will remain quiet 
               if someone complains that the teacher is too pious (usually a lawyer or a doctor or similar who has little knowledge of religion and is hardly pious), nobody should think only he is a “fanatic” under no circumstances…
            </p>
            <p>
               Not that anyone now thinks we are telling fairy tales, that we are suspected of lies. We want to bring facts which have been created in a big jewish community here in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs>.               
            </p>
           <p>
              A Jewish religious educator who came to the knowledge that Jewish students are sitting in school on Sabbath, asked the director he shall free the children from writing on Sabbath, as the law does allow that. The director sent 
              this inquiry to the LEA, which sent it to the board of the religious community, if writing on Sabbath is indeed prohibited. This inquiry has had an answer from the religious board for a few months now. They do not have the audacity 
              to say they should be writing; to say no on the other shames him, in case someone might say the board are fanatics!... We think that it is a bigger shame to be silent about this for so long.
           </p>
            <p>A second case happened in the same city: A Jewish teacher talked about the <ref source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Moses">Law of Moses</ref>, the children reported this at home, some pious Jewish people told the school inspector and he initiated an investigation and 
               interrogated the children as witnesses. The Jewish doctor who is the representative in the LEA, who should have been most angered about the Jewish teacher, helped her and wanted to twist the children's answers with various 
               questions in order to make several pull back their statements. He didn't achieve this, but this case shows how far the interests of the Jewish representatives in the LEA go for the Jewish religion.
            </p>
            <p>
               Are those two tales proof enough, or should we describe more stories? - We don’t think that as necessary: every Jewish reader knows stories like this of their own experience. There are very little or even no Jewish religious 
               educators who are not complained about and there are few schools where stories like this don’t circulate.
            </p>
            <p>
               <cb/>However, we can say that the education in school according to the required methods, doesn’t get to the children. They stay unfamiliar with religion, its people and their faith.
            </p>

            <head>Letter from <rs type="place">Hungary</rs></head>
            <p>
               The Hungarian Jews, their lives, their political and economical situation, are not really known to our Jewish readers. The Hungarian Jew is a different “type”, he differs from the Polish and the German ones. 
               They live miles apart and don’t come in contact with each other. I’m not looking to describe Hungarian Jewish people in detail, their situation, their conditions and their states. I will do that in another 
               letter. I just want to share important information which will interest every Jew.
            </p>
            <p>
               In <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> live - beside <ref source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarians">Magyars</ref> - several other tribes, like Germans, Romanians, Slowakians, Croatians, Ruthenians and others.
               Together they would be the majority in the whole populace and the Magyars do know that if all those tribes get together, <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> would not be a Magyarianian state, nor a Slavish one. 
               Therefore they strive to strengthen the Magyarian populace, suppress the other nationalities, refuse them their national pride and don’t let them develop their national interests. The Jewish people in 
               <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> are always loyal to the government, supporting it in every situation and above all, the government has always got massive support during elections in the cities, where many Jewish 
               people live among Romanians and Slavic people. Without Jewish people, Slavic people would have been elected into the government. Where few Hungarians live, Jewish people help Hungarians to a successful election.
            </p>
            <p>
               Furthermore, the Jewish people in <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> can influence the government in certain ways and if they want something, they have the power to do so. Still, there have been some cases where the 
               government issued laws, which harmed Jewish people there. The last minister president <rs type="person"><ref  source="person034">Kálmán Széll</ref></rs> allowed Christians to open shops and banks in frontier districts where a lot of Jewish 
               people live among Ruthenians and Slavs in order to support the populace there. That harmed the Jewish people there. As soon as they opposed it, the government had to stop. Jewish people seem to have a bit more 
               influence in <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> compared to other countries.
            </p>
            <p>
               This influence also proved useful in the case of the Sunday rest. Many pious Jewish people, especially in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs>, suffer under the law of Sunday Rest. They close their shop on Sabbath 
               and also have to do so on Sunday. Closing their stores two days a week is difficult, especially for the little merchant. The Hungarian Jewish people managed to achieve some relief.
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb/>A few months ago, the government issued a decree for every tobacco shop to be open for business on Sabbath. The licence is to be revoked of those who keep it closed on Sabbath. This decree has been a 
               serious “punishment”. Several tobacconists, who didn’t want their licence to be revoked, and have therefore violated Sabbath. However, many pious Jewish people insisted and have not lost their livelihood over 
               this. The Jewish people have raised tumult: they have handed over petitions to the finance minister. Last week he gave confirmation to the chancellery of Orthodox Jews in Budapest that he meets half of their 
               demands. That means: he issued another decree that those who ran their shops before the previous decree may close their shops on Sabbath. And those who have had their licences revoked, will get it back. Still, 
               tobacconists who get their licence now have to vow to keep their shop open on Sabbath. In other words, pious Jewish people cannot open tobacco shops anymore…
            </p>
            <p>
               The minister has already written to the chancellery that he cannot back down anymore and they cannot ask for more. However, the pious Jewish people of Hungary must not remain silent and have to use all means
               at their disposal to abolish the rest of this punishment. If the government doesn’t want to give in, they have to turn to the parliament. And if that doesn’t help as well they have to submit to our Lord, 
               King … and they will hopefully achieve everything. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Jewish people have made Romanians and Slavs their enemies because they have always supported the government! In those places where a lot of Slavs live there is a great hostility between them and the Jewish 
               people there which leads to fights and brawls. I do not want to judge whether the Jewish people gain advantages for themselves by being devoted to the Magyars and therefore make enemies with the other peoples. 
               Maybe it would have been better for the Jewish people to stay neutral and not form alliances with any other nationality. I want to write about that another time. The Jewish people are already suffering because #
               they support the government and should therefore not make them suffer more. However, if the government forgets their duty, the Jewish people need to remind them as long as they are listened to.

            <head>The War
            <lb/>Between <rs type="place">Japan</rs> and <rs type="place">Russia</rs></head>
            <p>
               After lengthy negotiation going back and forth, the war between <rs type="place">Japan</rs> and <rs type="place">Russia</rs> has ultimately broken out. Both have hesitated a long time, waiting for the other 
               one to start the one so as to not bear the responsibility of inaugurating it. <cb/> Finally, Japan lost its patience and called back their ambassador from Petersburg immediately leading to war. The first few 
               days, news from Japanese victories at sea have been received. If Japan beats Russia at sea, the war will continue on the mainland. It is not clear yet how exactly both armies will crash against each other. 
               First of all, no one knows how fast both want to reach the capital of <rs type="place">Korea</rs>, <rs type="place">Seoul</rs>. It’s therefore possible that the first war on land will be happening in 
               <rs type="place">Korea</rs>. If Japan gets to occupy <rs type="place">Korea</rs> before the Russian military manages to get there, both enemies will already meet at the border of <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>. 
               The Japanese military plans to invade <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> in order to split the Russian military into two parts and weaken their forces. Japan moves particularly cautiously to invade <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> 
               in secret. They want to destroy Russian connections to their country, to demolish their railroads and cut their supply stream of food and war materials in order to facilitate the Japanese victory in the end. 
            </p>

               News of the first Japanese victories impressed the whole world, therefore leading to hope it would be easier for Japan to make peace. Japan will be content with their first victories and would be inclined 
               to make peace sooner. Russia was also scared of the war before it broke out and will certainly give in. Different sources talk about peace enforcement. Some say the <rs type="person"><ref source="person035">Pope [Pious X]</ref></rs> 
               will be the “mediator”, others talk about our <rs type="person"><ref source="person003">Emperor Franz Josef</ref></rs> being an arbitrator, but for now nothing of that is true. No one so far has come forward to mediate and nobody wants to. 
               - Every government declared themselves as “neutral”, meaning they are not supporting any party and just want to watch. Except for England, they support Japan in secret. There is a rumour that England won’t 
               let Russian ships pass through the <rs type="place">Mediterranean Sea</rs> to <rs type="place">East Asia</rs>, through the <rs type="place">Dardanellen</rs> or through the <rs type="place">Suez-Canal</rs>.

               Russia is trying to receive loans, but after the first losses, there are doubts they will get money.

               No one can say for sure how long the war will last, but it seems like it will end soon. A long war, which will not be cheap for Russia, will cause revolutions inside the country. Rumour has it there are preparations 
               for a revolution in <rs type="place">Russian Poland</rs> already. Therefore, Russia needs to end the war soon to keep its own country in check. The idiom: “The camel wanted horns, but cut off the ears as well” became 
               true for Russia now. Russia wanted <pb/> to invade foreign countries, but is now busy with its own land.

               The whole world is now curious how this war will end - if Russia or Japan will emerge as victor. Never before has everyone been so invested in a war, which is happening in a faraway country. Neither the war between 
               China and Japan ten years ago nor the war between Spain and America five years ago was in everyone’s mind like that because the end result was not important for the whole world. However, now, it is of great importance. 
               If Russia loses, its power will be forever broken, the dissatisfaction inside the country will grow. Either Russia has to issue a constitution and stop the tyrannical reign or revolutions will reign through the whole 
               country and bring it to ruins. If Japan loses, the chances to advance into a <hi rend="italic">Worldwar</hi> in all of <rs type="place">Europe</rs> and <rs type="place">Asia</rs> is tremendous. Nobody will support 
               Russia as every country is in conflict with them. Even their ally, France, is not happy with Russia’s occupation of <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>. Japan has England and America on their side, as Japan is waging 
               war for them as well. They want the same thing Japan does: for Russia to leave <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>. But if England and America support Japan, France will certainly not watch from afar. Then, Germany and 
               Italy also need to intervene, therefore developing the war into a world war, for which no one can know how that will end.

            <p>
               An important question now is the significance the Russian-Japanese war has in <rs type="place">Austria-Hungary</rs>. On the outside, Austria-Hungary and Russia are at peace, but the differences between those two countries 
               have not ceased to exist. Austria-Hungary has always been in conflict with Russia about Russia settling in Turkey and bothering Austria there. Austria can breathe a sigh of relief and act more freely in the Balkan, now that 
               Russia is occupied in Asia. The time has come for Austria to declare <rs type="place">Bosnia</rs> and <rs type="place">Herzegovina</rs> as its own. Until now, those two countries belonged to <rs type="place">Turkey</rs> while 
               Austria had merely occupied it. 
            </p>
            <p>
               There is another reason why Austria is interested in the Russian-Japanese War. As is known, Bulgaria intends to wage war with Turkey for a while now as <rs type="place">Macedonia</rs> belongs to <rs type="place">Bulgaria</rs>. 
               Additionally, <rs type="place">Montenegro</rs> is also constantly looking to involve Turkey in a conflict. Bulgaria and Montenegro hope to drive Turkey completely out of Europe. And if they lose the war, they may take no 
               damage from it like <rs type="place">Greece</rs> has taken no damage after losing the war with Turkey. The European powers did not let something bad happen to Greece. Even though Turkey has won the war, they had to give up 
               the island <hi rend="italic"><rs type="place">Crete</rs></hi>. Therefore, Bulgaria and Montenegro hope for the Christian powers to interfere in case they lose the war and take <rs type="place">Macedonia</rs> away from Turkey. 
               <rs type="place">Serbia</rs> has <cb/> not wanted to interfere with disputes on the <rs type="place">Balkan</rs> as long as <rs type="person"><ref source="person038">King Aleksandar [I of Serbia]</ref></rs> has ruled. However, since the revolution against 
               <rs type="person">King Aleksandar</rs> and the war of the new king, <rs type="person"><ref source="person037">King Peter [I of Serbia]</ref></rs>, dissatisfaction has risen in the 
               country. The king has not punished the murder of <rs type="person">King Aleksandar</rs> but started a war with Turkey to quench the discontent in the country.
            </p>
            <p>
               Until now, every <rs type="place">Balkan</rs> country was afraid to declare war on Turkey, because Austria-Hungary and Russia warned them not to start as they don’t want the situation in Turkey to change. But now, as Russia 
               is occupied in <rs type="place">Asia</rs>, the question is whether the <rs type="place">Balkan</rs> countries prepare for war. News came via telegram that Austria-Hungary needs to convene their reservists and prepare in case a 
               war breaks out in <rs type="place">Turkey</rs>. - The Russian-Japanese war can therefore have set off another war which is of great interest to Austria-Hungary as well as the whole world. - Besides, the whole world is greatly 
               interested in the war in Russia and expect daily news from the warside.

            <head>The first Russian defeat.</head>
            <p>
               Russia has already been harshly defeated in three battles on the ocean in the first few days of war. The first losses have shown that the Russian marines are not able to oppose the Japanese one on the water making one think the 
               war is as good as won to the benefit of Japan. Over half of the Russian ships which are in <rs type="place">East Asia</rs> have already been destroyed or at least have been incapacitated. Part of the other half are in the port 
               of <rs type="place"><hi rend="italic">Vladivostok</hi></rs> which is frozen over leading to the ships being stuck in there. The other part is stationed in <rs type="place">Port Arthur</rs>, this part alone is not strong enough 
               to combat Japan. Therefore, those ships will have to stay in the port and wait until Japan arrives to destroy the battle ships left. 
            </p>
            <p>
               The Japanese military showed their understanding of warfare, they proved courage and initiative. As eyewitnesses report, Japanese bullets and cannons always fired their shot and landed it as well, while the Russian projectiles 
               didn’t even hit their target once. - The start of the Russian-Japanese war seems similar to the start of the <ref source="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War">Spanish-American war</ref> some time ago. 
               Back then, the first battle also happened on the ocean, the American admiral <rs type="person"><ref source="person036"><hi rend="italic">Dewey</hi> [George]</ref></rs> destroyed the entire Spanish marine in front of the <rs type="place">Philippines</rs> 
               in one night and steered the war into the direction of the American victory. The Japanese-Russian war seems to go along these lines as well. Because of these first victories Japan managed to prevent the Russian marines from 
               reaching Korea and marching into <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> from there. The first battles on land will probably occur in <rs type="place">Korea</rs> or at the border to <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> and as it seems, 
               Japan will win. They are better prepared and show more courage. The Russians on the other hand have lost some of their courage after the first <pb/>losses and lost courage don’t fare well on the battlefield. When the troops fall, 
               they will fall.
