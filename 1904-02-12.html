                  Our religious education
                  
                  <p id="p__2" class="yes-index">“One could almost laugh about it, if it wasn’t so sad”... We can justifiably use this
                     general idiom in regards to the religious education at our public schools when accusing
                     our advanced Jewish people 
                     that our religious education is substantially neglected. Our children grow up without
                     a Jewish consciousness concerning religion and faith, they do not know anything about
                     the Jewry, about Jewish celebrations, 
                     or about Jewish music. The educated Jewry then points to the religious education in
                     the schools, that a religious educator is employed in every school who is paid by
                     the Jewish community, that a representative 
                     of the Jewish community sits in the local education authority, that according to the
                     law the religious education is crucial in education. A student might be perfectly
                     educated, but if he doesn’t know about 
                     religion he will not pass the exam - because of all of that they know that the religious
                     education is esteemed and highly renowned and everything is to be done in order to
                     educate the children religiously. 
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__4" class="yes-index">All of those responses are correct. We have religious educators in every school -
                     but nobody asks what kind of educators they are? We have representatives in the local
                     education authorities, but nobody asks 
                     how concerned they are with our religious inquiries? - The Jewish communities pay
                     the teacher, but nobody asks how they care about the religious education? - The religious
                     education is a significant subject 
                     for every Jewish pupil, but nobody asks if it really happened that a Jewish student
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="anchor-pb"></span><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="pb" source=""></span>failed an exam because he didn’t know anything about religion?
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__4" class="yes-index">
                     The answer is: religious education in schools is a serious subject, but is not taught
                     seriously. We don’t want to use a harsher expression, otherwise we would have to say:
                     it is treated like a joke.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__7" class="yes-index">
                     The religious educator is for the most part not really pious. The children realise
                     that he thinks little of religion and what he teaches. Therefore, the religious education
                     doesn’t leave a big impression, 
                     they don’t take it seriously and take religion solely as a story, which they don’t
                     have to know anything about, like other historical chronicles. There isn’t really
                     an alternative; for the most part they 
                     are in school ignoring the Sabbath to learn writing, calculating and similar - how
                     should they think about the Sabbath as honourable? And if the religious educator is
                     a serious man, as those educators really 
                     are, then he has a serious challenge with children of non-pious parents. For example,
                     if he learns in school that eating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chametz" target="_blank">Chametz</a> is not allowed during 
                     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover" target="_blank">Passover</a> - and that child goes home and eats Chametz , then goes back to school and explains
                     that the teacher lied about Chametz  not being  forbidden 
                     to eat .The same happens with the Sabbath observance and other big customs of the
                     Jewish religion.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__7" class="yes-index">
                     But if a teacher who wants to take a stance against that and wants to convince the
                     children that the religion he teaches is the true Jewry - then a fight against him
                     rises. He gets reported to the Local 
                     Education Administration, an investigation against him gets instigated and he is <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="anchor-pb"></span><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="pb" source=""></span> being assaulted until he shuts up and is quiet.                
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__7" class="yes-index">
                     However, a Jewish representative sits in the Local Education Administration, who should
                     take on the teacher, because doesn’t he sit there for exactly that reason? You will
                     of course ask, but that is indeed a bad 
                     thing. The Jewish school inspector wants to demonstrate that he is a modern man, not
                     a fanatic and only cares about the religion teacher if pious parents complain that
                     the lessons are bad. But he will remain quiet 
                     if someone complains that the teacher is too pious (usually a lawyer or a doctor or
                     similar who has little knowledge of religion and is hardly pious), nobody should think
                     only he is a “fanatic” under no circumstances…
                     </p>

                     Not that anyone now thinks we are telling fairy tales, that we are suspected of lies.
                     We want to bring facts which have been created in a big jewish community here in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Galicia</span>.

                     A Jewish religious educator who came to the knowledge that Jewish students are sitting
                     in school on Sabbath, asked the director he shall free the children from writing on
                     Sabbath, as the law does allow that. The director sent 
                     this inquiry to the LEA, which sent it to the board of the religious community, if
                     writing on Sabbath is indeed prohibited. This inquiry has had an answer from the religious
                     board for a few months now. They do not have the audacity 
                     to say they should be writing; to say no on the other shames him, in case someone
                     might say the board are fanatics!... We think that it is a bigger shame to be silent
                     about this for so long.

                  <p id="p__11" class="yes-index">A second case happened in the same city: A Jewish teacher talked about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Moses" target="_blank">Law of Moses</a>, the children reported this at home, some pious Jewish people told the school inspector
                     and he initiated an investigation and 
                     interrogated the children as witnesses. The Jewish doctor who is the representative
                     in the LEA, who should have been most angered about the Jewish teacher, helped her
                     and wanted to twist the children's answers with various 
                     questions in order to make several pull back their statements. He didn't achieve this,
                     but this case shows how far the interests of the Jewish representatives in the LEA
                     go for the Jewish religion.

                     Are those two tales proof enough, or should we describe more stories? - We don’t think
                     that as necessary: every Jewish reader knows stories like this of their own experience.
                     There are very little or even no Jewish religious 
                     educators who are not complained about and there are few schools where stories like
                     this don’t circulate.

                     doesn’t get to the children. They stay unfamiliar with religion, its people and their

                     The Hungarian Jews, their lives, their political and economical situation, are not
                     really known to our Jewish readers. The Hungarian Jew is a different “type”, he differs
                     from the Polish and the German ones. 
                     They live miles apart and don’t come in contact with each other. I’m not looking to
                     describe Hungarian Jewish people in detail, their situation, their conditions and
                     their states. I will do that in another 
                     letter. I just want to share important information which will interest every Jew.

                     and others.
                     Together they would be the majority in the whole populace and the Magyars do know
                     that if all those tribes get together, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Hungary</span> would not be a Magyarianian state, nor a Slavish one. 
                     Therefore they strive to strengthen the Magyarian populace, suppress the other nationalities,
                     refuse them their national pride and don’t let them develop their national interests.
                     The Jewish people in 
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Hungary</span> are always loyal to the government, supporting it in every situation and above all,
                     the government has always got massive support during elections in the cities, where
                     many Jewish 
                     people live among Romanians and Slavic people. Without Jewish people, Slavic people
                     would have been elected into the government. Where few Hungarians live, Jewish people
                     help Hungarians to a successful election.

                     Furthermore, the Jewish people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Hungary</span> can influence the government in certain ways and if they want something, they have
                     the power to do so. Still, there have been some cases where the 
                     government issued laws, which harmed Jewish people there. The last minister president
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Kálmán Széll</span> allowed Christians to open shops and banks in frontier districts where a lot of Jewish
                     
                     people live among Ruthenians and Slavs in order to support the populace there. That
                     harmed the Jewish people there. As soon as they opposed it, the government had to
                     stop. Jewish people seem to have a bit more 
                     influence in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Hungary</span> compared to other countries.

                     This influence also proved useful in the case of the Sunday rest. Many pious Jewish
                     people, especially in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Galicia</span>, suffer under the law of Sunday Rest. They close their shop on Sabbath 
                     and also have to do so on Sunday. Closing their stores two days a week is difficult,
                     especially for the little merchant. The Hungarian Jewish people managed to achieve
                     some relief.

                     for business on Sabbath. The licence is to be revoked of those who keep it closed
                     on Sabbath. This decree has been a 
                     serious “punishment”. Several tobacconists, who didn’t want their licence to be revoked,
                     and have therefore violated Sabbath. However, many pious Jewish people insisted and
                     have not lost their livelihood over 
                     this. The Jewish people have raised tumult: they have handed over petitions to the
                     finance minister. Last week he gave confirmation to the chancellery of Orthodox Jews
                     in Budapest that he meets half of their 
                     demands. That means: he issued another decree that those who ran their shops before
                     the previous decree may close their shops on Sabbath. And those who have had their
                     licences revoked, will get it back. Still, 
                     tobacconists who get their licence now have to vow to keep their shop open on Sabbath.
                     In other words, pious Jewish people cannot open tobacco shops anymore…

                  <p id="p__7" class="yes-index">
                     The minister has already written to the chancellery that he cannot back down anymore
                     and they cannot ask for more. However, the pious Jewish people of Hungary must not
                     remain silent and have to use all means
                     at their disposal to abolish the rest of this punishment. If the government doesn’t
                     want to give in, they have to turn to the parliament. And if that doesn’t help as
                     well they have to submit to our Lord, 
                     King … and they will hopefully achieve everything.

                     Jewish people have made Romanians and Slavs their enemies because they have always
                     supported the government! In those places where a lot of Slavs live there is a great
                     hostility between them and the Jewish 
                     people there which leads to fights and brawls. I do not want to judge whether the
                     Jewish people gain advantages for themselves by being devoted to the Magyars and therefore
                     make enemies with the other peoples. 
                     Maybe it would have been better for the Jewish people to stay neutral and not form
                     alliances with any other nationality. I want to write about that another time. The
                     Jewish people are already suffering because #
                     they support the government and should therefore not make them suffer more. However,
                     if the government forgets their duty, the Jewish people need to remind them as long
                     as they are listened to.

                     one to start the one so as to not bear the responsibility of inaugurating it.  Finally, Japan lost its patience and called back their ambassador from Petersburg
                     immediately leading to war. The first few 
                     days, news from Japanese victories at sea have been received. If Japan beats Russia
                     at sea, the war will continue on the mainland. It is not clear yet how exactly both
