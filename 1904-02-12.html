                     Our religious education
                     
                     <p id="p__2" class="yes-index">“One could almost laugh about it, if it wasn’t so sad”... We can justifiably use this
                        general idiom in regards to the religious education at our public schools when accusing
                        our advanced Jewish people 
                        that our religious education is substantially neglected. Our children grow up without
                        a Jewish consciousness concerning religion and faith, they do not know anything about
                        the Jewry, about Jewish celebrations, 
                        or about Jewish music. The educated Jewry then points to the religious education in
                        the schools, that a religious educator is employed in every school who is paid by
                        the Jewish community, that a representative 
                        of the Jewish community sits in the local education authority, that according to the
                        law the religious education is crucial in education. A student might be perfectly
                        educated, but if he doesn’t know about 
                        religion he will not pass the exam - because of all of that they know that the religious
                        education is esteemed and highly renowned and everything is to be done in order to
                        educate the children religiously. 
                        </p>
                     
                     <p id="p__4" class="yes-index">All of those responses are correct. We have religious educators in every school -
                        but nobody asks what kind of educators they are? We have representatives in the local
                        education authorities, but nobody asks 
                        how concerned they are with our religious inquiries? - The Jewish communities pay
                        the teacher, but nobody asks how they care about the religious education? - The religious
                        education is a significant subject 
                        for every Jewish pupil, but nobody asks if it really happened that a Jewish student

                        </p>
                     
                     <p id="p__4" class="yes-index">
                        The answer is: religious education in schools is a serious subject, but is not taught
                        seriously. We don’t want to use a harsher expression, otherwise we would have to say:
                        it is treated like a joke.
                        </p>
                     
                     <p id="p__7" class="yes-index">
                        The religious educator is for the most part not really pious. The children realise
                        that he thinks little of religion and what he teaches. Therefore, the religious education
                        doesn’t leave a big impression, 
                        they don’t take it seriously and take religion solely as a story, which they don’t
                        have to know anything about, like other historical chronicles. There isn’t really
                        an alternative; for the most part they 
                        are in school ignoring the Sabbath to learn writing, calculating and similar - how
                        should they think about the Sabbath as honourable? And if the religious educator is
                        a serious man, as those educators really 
                        are, then he has a serious challenge with children of non-pious parents. For example,

                        to eat .The same happens with the Sabbath observance and other big customs of the

                        writing on Sabbath is indeed prohibited. This inquiry has had an answer from the religious

                        and others.
                        Together they would be the majority in the whole populace and the Magyars do know
                        that if all those tribes get together, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Hungary</span> would not be a Magyarianian state, nor a Slavish one.

                        people live among Ruthenians and Slavs in order to support the populace there. That
                        harmed the Jewish people there. As soon as they opposed it, the government had to
                        stop. Jewish people seem to have a bit more

                        especially for the little merchant. The Hungarian Jewish people managed to achieve
                        some relief.

                        for business on Sabbath. The licence is to be revoked of those who keep it closed
                        on Sabbath. This decree has been a 
                        serious “punishment”. Several tobacconists, who didn’t want their licence to be revoked,
                        and have therefore violated Sabbath. However, many pious Jewish people insisted and
                        have not lost their livelihood over 
                        this. The Jewish people have raised tumult: they have handed over petitions to the
                        finance minister. Last week he gave confirmation to the chancellery of Orthodox Jews
                        in Budapest that he meets half of their 
                        demands. That means: he issued another decree that those who ran their shops before
                        the previous decree may close their shops on Sabbath. And those who have had their
                        licences revoked, will get it back. Still, 
                        tobacconists who get their licence now have to vow to keep their shop open on Sabbath.

                        remain silent and have to use all means
                        at their disposal to abolish the rest of this punishment. If the government doesn’t
                        want to give in, they have to turn to the parliament. And if that doesn’t help as

                        make enemies with the other peoples.

                        facilitate the Japanese victory in the end.

                        The whole world is now curious how this war will end - if Russia or Japan will emerge
                        as victor. Never before has everyone been so invested in a war, which is happening
                        in a faraway country. Neither the war between 
                        China and Japan ten years ago nor the war between Spain and America five years ago
                        was in everyone’s mind like that because the end result was not important for the
                        whole world. However, now, it is of great importance. 
                        If Russia loses, its power will be forever broken, the dissatisfaction inside the
                        country will grow. Either Russia has to issue a constitution and stop the tyrannical
                        reign or revolutions will reign through the whole 
                        country and bring it to ruins. If Japan loses, the chances to advance into a <em>Worldwar</em> in all of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Europe</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Asia</span> is tremendous. Nobody will support 
                        Russia as every country is in conflict with them. Even their ally, France, is not
                        happy with Russia’s occupation of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. Japan has England and America on their side, as Japan is waging 
                        war for them as well. They want the same thing Japan does: for Russia to leave <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. But if England and America support Japan, France will certainly not watch from afar.
                        Then, Germany and 
                        Italy also need to intervene, therefore developing the war into a world war, for which
                        no one can know how that will end.

                        An important question now is the significance the Russian-Japanese war has in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Austria-Hungary</span>. On the outside, Austria-Hungary and Russia are at peace, but the differences between
                        those two countries 
                        have not ceased to exist. Austria-Hungary has always been in conflict with Russia
                        about Russia settling in Turkey and bothering Austria there. Austria can breathe a
                        sigh of relief and act more freely in the Balkan, now that 
                        Russia is occupied in Asia. The time has come for Austria to declare <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Bosnia</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Herzegovina</span> as its own. Until now, those two countries belonged to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Turkey</span> while 
                        Austria had merely occupied it.

                     <p id="p__22" class="yes-index">
                        There is another reason why Austria is interested in the Russian-Japanese War. As
                        is known, Bulgaria intends to wage war with Turkey for a while now as <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Macedonia</span> belongs to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Bulgaria</span>. 
                        Additionally, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Montenegro</span> is also constantly looking to involve Turkey in a conflict. Bulgaria and Montenegro
                        hope to drive Turkey completely out of Europe. And if they lose the war, they may
                        take no 
                        damage from it like <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Greece</span> has taken no damage after losing the war with Turkey. The European powers did not
                        let something bad happen to Greece. Even though Turkey has won the war, they had to
                        give up 
                        the island <em><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Crete</span></em>. Therefore, Bulgaria and Montenegro hope for the Christian powers to interfere in
                        case they lose the war and take <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Macedonia</span> away from Turkey. 
                        <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Serbia</span> has  not wanted to interfere with disputes on the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Balkan</span> as long as <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person038" target="_blank">King Aleksandar [I of Serbia]</a></span> has ruled.

                        country. The king has not punished the murder of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">King Aleksandar</span> but started a war with Turkey to quench the discontent in the country.

                        them not to start as they don’t want the situation in Turkey to change. But now, as
                        Russia 
                        is occupied in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Asia</span>, the question is whether the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Balkan</span> countries prepare for war. News came via telegram that Austria-Hungary needs to convene

                        interest to Austria-Hungary as well as the whole world. - Besides, the whole world

                        Russia has already been harshly defeated in three battles on the ocean in the first
                        few days of war. The first losses have shown that the Russian marines are not able
                        to oppose the Japanese one on the water making one think the 
                        war is as good as won to the benefit of Japan. Over half of the Russian ships which
                        are in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">East Asia</span> have already been destroyed or at least have been incapacitated. Part of the other

                        to combat Japan. Therefore, those ships will have to stay in the port and wait until
                        Japan arrives to destroy the battle ships left.

                        The Japanese military showed their understanding of warfare, they proved courage and
                        initiative. As eyewitnesses report, Japanese bullets and cannons always fired their
                        shot and landed it as well, while the Russian projectiles 
                        didn’t even hit their target once. - The start of the Russian-Japanese war seems similar
                        to the start of the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12583" target="_blank">Spanish-American war</a> some time ago. 
                        Back then, the first battle also happened on the ocean, the American admiral <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person036" target="_blank"><em>Dewey</em> [George]</a></span> destroyed the entire Spanish marine in front of the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Philippines</span> 
                        in one night and steered the war into the direction of the American victory. The Japanese-Russian
                        war seems to go along these lines as well. Because of these first victories Japan
                        managed to prevent the Russian marines from 
                        reaching Korea and marching into <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> from there. The first battles on land will probably occur in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span> or at the border to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> and as it seems, 
                        Japan will win. They are better prepared and show more courage. The Russians on the

                        That is how the first message from the war side is written. One could imagine that
                        if the Russian admiral delivered this telegram, the Russian loss must have been more
                        severe as he has let on, as later sources described. The Japanese attacked 
                        worked so well: the Russian battle ships shot back, but did not hit their targets
                        and did not damage the Japanese. To caluclate the losses, it is important to understand
                        what it means when an armed battle ship gets destroyed. Generally, an 
                        armed battle ship is to be understood as an <em>entire army corps</em>. A battle ship is worth 20 million. As Russia lost three battle ships during the
                        first attack, it amounts to three corps and 60 million. Furthermore, 
                        the loss of a ship is even greater, as building a ship like this takes years and years
                        and the damage cannot be restored.

                        Two officers and 54 soldiers are wounded, 10 soldiers have been killed. The Russian

                     The causes of the war.
                     
                     <p id="p__9" class="yes-index">
                        The war between Russia and Japan broke out mainly because of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. Meaning, Russia and Japan are not at war because of their own countries, but because
                        of foreign ones. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span> is a 
                        small country, amassing 218,650 square kilometres with 10 million inhabitants. Those
                        inhabitants are great fanatics, lazy, half-asleep and live like their ancestors a
                        hundred years ago. The ruler of the country calls himself an “emperor”, but is in
                        reality a 
                        man without courage or power; foreign ambassadors do whatever they want. He is controlled
                        by the Russian ambassador as well as the Japanese, the English and the American one,
                        and even by women. A Russian cook and an English governess influence him greatly.
                        
                        He just lets it all happen. Up until 10 years ago, China had the biggest authority
                        in Korea, formally it belonged to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">China</span>. Because of Korea, the last Chinese-Japanese war, where Japan emerged as victor,
                        broke out as well. Back then, 
                        Japan wanted to take all of Korea, but the allied powers of Germany, Russia, and France
                        interfered and forced Japan to acknowledge <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span> as an independent state - not part of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">China</span>, not part of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Japan</span>. 
                        However, Japan needs Korea because of trade, it needs to settle their merchants there.
                        After the war, Russia started to invade Korea and to cause problems for Japan causing
                        the Russian-Japanese relationship to be strained and irritated.

                     <p id="p__13" class="yes-index">
                        After the last uprising in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">China</span>, the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q150229" target="_blank">Boxer Rebellion</a>, where the “Boxers” rose up against foreigners, every country sent their military
                        there to suppress the rebellion. 
                        After the situation calmed down, everyone’s military retreated, except for Russia,
                        which stayed in the Chinese province of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. Russia occupied this region during the rebellion and refused to retreat. At first,
                        it was looking 
                        for different excused, but the other <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="anchor-pb"></span><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="pb" source=""></span> governments demanded Russia to vacate the area - after that Russia forced China to
                        enter in an agreement after which Russia is allowed to keep occupying the province
                        <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuaria</span> as long as it wants to.

                        of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>, Russia became a closer neighbour to Korea, which bothered Japan quite a lot. But
                        also other governments are not 
                        satisfied with this situation, mainly England and America, which are interested in
                        <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> because of trade. Therefore, they put stones in Russia’s path and disrupted their
                        trading. They wanted to close every Manchurian harbours for 
                        foreign trade. Still, China went into agreement with several other governments allowing
                        them to trade however much they want. England and America therefore drove Japan continuously
                        to not let Russia fob them off. And Japan, who could be sure that it had two 
                        big powers backing them up, demanded of Russia to relinquish any Korean influence
                        and vacate <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. The negotiations dragged on for months. Russia agreed to give up influence on Korea,
                        but not to leave <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> - 
                        but Japan demanded both.

                        Lately, Russia started to prepare for war in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Asia</span>. Japan on the other side, also braced themselves for war. After a while, Japan realised
                        that Russia took ages to answer Japan’s demand and hesitated for weeks on end, therefore
                        only playing 
                        for time in order to finish preparing for war. Hence, Japan called back their ambassador
                        from <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Petersburg</span>, meaning Japan is not ready anymore to negotiate with Russia, meaning Japan will
                        protect their rights with a blade. On Sunday then, 
                        the <em>war</em> began.

                        which means the mountain erupts fire. The climate there is healthy: in the summer
                        there is a warm and moist south wind, in the winter it is cold, 
                        harsh north wind. The population grows continuously. Each year it grows by 1/9. Every
                        year, there are 350,000 marriages and 100,000 divorces. Each year over one million
                        children are being born while 800,000 people die. Japan has a lot of big cities, for
                        example 
                        the capital, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tokyo</em></span> with 1,350,000 inhabitants, Osaka - 500,000, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Kyoto</span> - 340,000, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Nogoya</span> - 250,000, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Taiwan</span> - 240,000, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Kōbe</span> - 200,000,

                        speak the same language, wear the same clothes, practise the same customs and religion.
                        Concerning their looks, they are similar to Mongols. The men’s 
                        average height is 158 cm and women’s 145 cm, their skin tone is of a light yellow,
                        their hair is black as well as thick and strong, but their facial hair thin and weak.
                        Some time ago they used to wear plaits like the Chinese, but since they got more civilised
                        
                        they cut them off. The Japanese are known  are known for their cleanliness, they are kind, decent, and polite. Their children
                        respect and honour their parents. There are several schools and a university in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Japan</span>, where Hebrew is taught 
                        as well. Over 800 newspapers and bulletins are published there. The press law is very
                        strict. The Japanese people lead a moderate lifestyle, they mostly eat rice, millet,
                        fish and similar, but not a lot of meat. Their clothes are made of linen, their houses
                        are 
                        lowly built and made out of wood, and the roofs are made out of shingles or covered
                        with straw - very rarely bricks are used. As the houses are built very closely next
                        to each other, fires can spread quickly. - Most Japanese live off of farming, livestock
                        breeding, 
                        and mining. As of recently, factories were being built which export their merchandise
                        abroad. The arts are rather developed, Japanese paper, porcelain, and paintings are
                        known all over the globe.

In the city of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Settat</span>, persecutions against Jewish people broke out. While the Jewish people were doing

                        children, looted their houses. After they have killed numerous Jewish people, they
                        took their women and children as captives. Over 300 houses were destroyed. The Arabs
                        demand a lot of money to free the captives

                        This story we are telling here is historically true and happened in the old city of

In the thirteenth century - according to the Gregorian calendar - 
                        the principality of <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130875" target="_blank">Hohenstauffen</a> ruled in this city. The city was surrounded with high walls and moats and the royal
                        palace is situated on a beautiful hill.  At this time the principality ruled over
                        
                        the whole land because one prince was the brother in law of the Roman emperor [<span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Frederick II</span>] - the ruler of Germany at that time. The German peoples were dissatisfied with their
                        sovereign and were said to have 
                        planned a rebellion. In 1285, the Count <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">[Eberhard I] of Wittenberg</span> started a rebellion in order to dispose of Emperor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rudolf [I]</span>, but Rudolf forcefully suppressed the rebellion with his military.

                        The Jewish people in  were valued at that time and have been protected by the prince against the masses,
                        which used to attack the Jewish people a lot. The clergyman incited 
                        violence against the Jewish people. The principality was short on money and borrowed
                        funds from the rich Jewish people leading to the principality protecting the Jewish
                        people and letting no harm happen to 
                        them. The principality therefore issued rights and privileges, forbidding anyone to
                        do harm as they were the prince’s subjects.

                  Our religious education
                  
                  <p id="p__2" class="yes-index">“One could almost laugh about it, if it wasn’t so sad”... We can justifiably use this
                     general idiom in regards to the religious education at our public schools when accusing
                     our advanced Jewish people 
                     that our religious education is substantially neglected. Our children grow up without
                     a Jewish consciousness concerning religion and faith, they do not know anything about
                     the Jewry, about Jewish celebrations, 
                     or about Jewish music. The educated Jewry then points to the religious education in
                     the schools, that a religious educator is employed in every school who is paid by
                     the Jewish community, that a representative 
                     of the Jewish community sits in the local education authority, that according to the
                     law the religious education is crucial in education. A student might be perfectly
                     educated, but if he doesn’t know about 
                     religion he will not pass the exam - because of all of that they know that the religious
                     education is esteemed and highly renowned and everything is to be done in order to
                     educate the children religiously. 
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__4" class="yes-index">All of those responses are correct. We have religious educators in every school -
                     but nobody asks what kind of educators they are? We have representatives in the local
                     education authorities, but nobody asks 
                     how concerned they are with our religious inquiries? - The Jewish communities pay
                     the teacher, but nobody asks how they care about the religious education? - The religious
                     education is a significant subject 
                     for every Jewish pupil, but nobody asks if it really happened that a Jewish student
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="anchor-pb"></span><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="pb" source=""></span>failed an exam because he didn’t know anything about religion?
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__4" class="yes-index">
                     The answer is: religious education in schools is a serious subject, but is not taught
                     seriously. We don’t want to use a harsher expression, otherwise we would have to say:
                     it is treated like a joke.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__7" class="yes-index">
                     The religious educator is for the most part not really pious. The children realise
                     that he thinks little of religion and what he teaches. Therefore, the religious education
                     doesn’t leave a big impression, 
                     they don’t take it seriously and take religion solely as a story, which they don’t
                     have to know anything about, like other historical chronicles. There isn’t really
                     an alternative; for the most part they 
                     are in school ignoring the Sabbath to learn writing, calculating and similar - how
                     should they think about the Sabbath as honourable? And if the religious educator is
                     a serious man, as those educators really 
                     are, then he has a serious challenge with children of non-pious parents. For example,
                     if he learns in school that eating <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1060878" target="_blank">Chametz</a> is not allowed during 
                     <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q121393" target="_blank">Passover</a> - and that child goes home and eats Chametz , then goes back to school and explains
                     that the teacher lied about Chametz  not being  forbidden 
                     to eat .The same happens with the Sabbath observance and other big customs of the
                     Jewish religion.
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__7" class="yes-index">
                     But if a teacher who wants to take a stance against that and wants to convince the
                     children that the religion he teaches is the true Jewry - then a fight against him
                     rises. He gets reported to the Local 
                     Education Administration, an investigation against him gets instigated and he is <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="anchor-pb"></span><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="pb" source=""></span> being assaulted until he shuts up and is quiet.                
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__7" class="yes-index">
                     However, a Jewish representative sits in the Local Education Administration, who should
                     take on the teacher, because doesn’t he sit there for exactly that reason? You will
                     of course ask, but that is indeed a bad 
                     thing. The Jewish school inspector wants to demonstrate that he is a modern man, not
                     a fanatic and only cares about the religion teacher if pious parents complain that
                     the lessons are bad. But he will remain quiet 
                     if someone complains that the teacher is too pious (usually a lawyer or a doctor or
                     similar who has little knowledge of religion and is hardly pious), nobody should think
                     only he is a “fanatic” under no circumstances…

                     A Jewish religious educator who came to the knowledge that Jewish students are sitting
                     in school on Sabbath, asked the director he shall free the children from writing on
                     Sabbath, as the law does allow that. The director sent 
                     this inquiry to the LEA, which sent it to the board of the religious community, if
                     writing on Sabbath is indeed prohibited. This inquiry has had an answer from the religious
                     board for a few months now. They do not have the audacity 
                     to say they should be writing; to say no on the other shames him, in case someone
                     might say the board are fanatics!... We think that it is a bigger shame to be silent
                     about this for so long.

                     and he initiated an investigation and 
                     interrogated the children as witnesses. The Jewish doctor who is the representative
                     in the LEA, who should have been most angered about the Jewish teacher, helped her
                     and wanted to twist the children's answers with various 
                     questions in order to make several pull back their statements. He didn't achieve this,
                     but this case shows how far the interests of the Jewish representatives in the LEA
                     go for the Jewish religion.

                     Are those two tales proof enough, or should we describe more stories? - We don’t think
                     that as necessary: every Jewish reader knows stories like this of their own experience.
                     There are very little or even no Jewish religious 
                     educators who are not complained about and there are few schools where stories like

                     and others.
                     Together they would be the majority in the whole populace and the Magyars do know
                     that if all those tribes get together, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Hungary</span> would not be a Magyarianian state, nor a Slavish one. 
                     Therefore they strive to strengthen the Magyarian populace, suppress the other nationalities,

                     the power to do so. Still, there have been some cases where the

                     people live among Ruthenians and Slavs in order to support the populace there. That
                     harmed the Jewish people there. As soon as they opposed it, the government had to
                     stop. Jewish people seem to have a bit more

                     and also have to do so on Sunday. Closing their stores two days a week is difficult,

                     for business on Sabbath. The licence is to be revoked of those who keep it closed
                     on Sabbath. This decree has been a 
                     serious “punishment”. Several tobacconists, who didn’t want their licence to be revoked,
                     and have therefore violated Sabbath. However, many pious Jewish people insisted and
                     have not lost their livelihood over 
                     this. The Jewish people have raised tumult: they have handed over petitions to the
                     finance minister. Last week he gave confirmation to the chancellery of Orthodox Jews
                     in Budapest that he meets half of their 
                     demands. That means: he issued another decree that those who ran their shops before
                     the previous decree may close their shops on Sabbath. And those who have had their
                     licences revoked, will get it back. Still, 
                     tobacconists who get their licence now have to vow to keep their shop open on Sabbath.
                     In other words, pious Jewish people cannot open tobacco shops anymore…

                     and they cannot ask for more. However, the pious Jewish people of Hungary must not
                     remain silent and have to use all means
                     at their disposal to abolish the rest of this punishment. If the government doesn’t
                     want to give in, they have to turn to the parliament. And if that doesn’t help as
                     well they have to submit to our Lord, 
                     King … and they will hopefully achieve everything.

                     Jewish people have made Romanians and Slavs their enemies because they have always
                     supported the government! In those places where a lot of Slavs live there is a great
                     hostility between them and the Jewish 
                     people there which leads to fights and brawls. I do not want to judge whether the
                     Jewish people gain advantages for themselves by being devoted to the Magyars and therefore
                     make enemies with the other peoples. 
                     Maybe it would have been better for the Jewish people to stay neutral and not form
                     alliances with any other nationality. I want to write about that another time. The
                     Jewish people are already suffering because #
                     they support the government and should therefore not make them suffer more. However,
                     if the government forgets their duty, the Jewish people need to remind them as long
                     as they are listened to.

                  <p id="p__12" class="yes-index">
                     After lengthy negotiation going back and forth, the war between <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Japan</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Russia</span> has ultimately broken out. Both have hesitated a long time, waiting for the other
                     
                     one to start the one so as to not bear the responsibility of inaugurating it.  Finally, Japan lost its patience and called back their ambassador from Petersburg
                     immediately leading to war. The first few 
                     days, news from Japanese victories at sea have been received. If Japan beats Russia
                     at sea, the war will continue on the mainland. It is not clear yet how exactly both
                     armies will crash against each other. 
                     First of all, no one knows how fast both want to reach the capital of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Seoul</span>. It’s therefore possible that the first war on land will be happening in 
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span>. If Japan gets to occupy <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span> before the Russian military manages to get there, both enemies will already meet
                     at the border of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. 
                     The Japanese military plans to invade <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> in order to split the Russian military into two parts and weaken their forces. Japan
                     moves particularly cautiously to invade <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> 
                     in secret. They want to destroy Russian connections to their country, to demolish
                     their railroads and cut their supply stream of food and war materials in order to
                     facilitate the Japanese victory in the end.

                     News of the first Japanese victories impressed the whole world, therefore leading
                     to hope it would be easier for Japan to make peace. Japan will be content with their
                     first victories and would be inclined 
                     to make peace sooner. Russia was also scared of the war before it broke out and will
                     certainly give in. Different sources talk about peace enforcement. Some say the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person035" target="_blank">Pope [Pious X]</a></span>

No one so far has come
                     forward to mediate and nobody wants to. 
                     - Every government declared themselves as “neutral”, meaning they are not supporting
                     any party and just want to watch. Except for England, they support Japan in secret.
                     There is a rumour that England won’t 
                     let Russian ships pass through the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Mediterranean Sea</span> to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">East Asia</span>, through the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Dardanellen</span> or through the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Suez-Canal</span>.

                     No one can say for sure how long the war will last, but it seems like it will end
                     soon. A long war, which will not be cheap for Russia, will cause revolutions inside

                     The idiom: “The camel wanted horns, but cut off the ears as well” became

                     The whole world is now curious how this war will end - if Russia or Japan will emerge
                     as victor. Never before has everyone been so invested in a war, which is happening
                     in a faraway country. Neither the war between 
                     China and Japan ten years ago nor the war between Spain and America five years ago
                     was in everyone’s mind like that because the end result was not important for the
                     whole world. However, now, it is of great importance. 
                     If Russia loses, its power will be forever broken, the dissatisfaction inside the
                     country will grow. Either Russia has to issue a constitution and stop the tyrannical
                     reign or revolutions will reign through the whole 
                     country and bring it to ruins. If Japan loses, the chances to advance into a <em>Worldwar</em> in all of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Europe</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Asia</span> is tremendous. Nobody will support 
                     Russia as every country is in conflict with them. Even their ally, France, is not
                     happy with Russia’s occupation of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. Japan has England and America on their side, as Japan is waging 
                     war for them as well. They want the same thing Japan does: for Russia to leave <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. But if England and America support Japan, France will certainly not watch from afar.
                     Then, Germany and 
                     Italy also need to intervene, therefore developing the war into a world war, for which
                     no one can know how that will end.

                  <p id="p__12" class="yes-index">
                     An important question now is the significance the Russian-Japanese war has in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Austria-Hungary</span>. On the outside, Austria-Hungary and Russia are at peace, but the differences between
                     those two countries 
                     have not ceased to exist. Austria-Hungary has always been in conflict with Russia
                     about Russia settling in Turkey and bothering Austria there. Austria can breathe a
                     sigh of relief and act more freely in the Balkan, now that 
                     Russia is occupied in Asia. The time has come for Austria to declare <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Bosnia</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Herzegovina</span> as its own. Until now, those two countries belonged to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Turkey</span> while 
                     Austria had merely occupied it. 
                     </p>
                  
                  <p id="p__22" class="yes-index">
                     There is another reason why Austria is interested in the Russian-Japanese War. As
                     is known, Bulgaria intends to wage war with Turkey for a while now as <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Macedonia</span> belongs to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Bulgaria</span>. 
                     Additionally, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Montenegro</span> is also constantly looking to involve Turkey in a conflict. Bulgaria and Montenegro
                     hope to drive Turkey completely out of Europe. And if they lose the war, they may
                     take no 
                     damage from it like <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Greece</span> has taken no damage after losing the war with Turkey. The European powers did not
                     let something bad happen to Greece. Even though Turkey has won the war, they had to
                     give up 
                     the island <em><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Crete</span></em>. Therefore, Bulgaria and Montenegro hope for the Christian powers to interfere in
                     case they lose the war and take <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Macedonia</span> away from Turkey. 
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Serbia</span> has  not wanted to interfere with disputes on the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Balkan</span> as long as <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person038" target="_blank">King Aleksandar [I of Serbia]</a></span> has ruled. However, since the revolution against 
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">King Aleksandar</span> and the war of the new king, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person037" target="_blank">King Peter [I of Serbia]</a></span>, dissatisfaction has risen in the 
                     country. The king has not punished the murder of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">King Aleksandar</span> but started a war with Turkey to quench the discontent in the country.

                     Until now, every <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Balkan</span> country was afraid to declare war on Turkey, because Austria-Hungary and Russia warned
                     them not to start as they don’t want the situation in Turkey to change. But now, as
                     Russia 
                     is occupied in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Asia</span>, the question is whether the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Balkan</span> countries prepare for war. News came via telegram that Austria-Hungary needs to convene
                     their reservists and prepare in case a

                     interest to Austria-Hungary as well as the whole world. - Besides, the whole world
                     is greatly

                     Russia has already been harshly defeated in three battles on the ocean in the first
                     few days of war. The first losses have shown that the Russian marines are not able
                     to oppose the Japanese one on the water making one think the 
                     war is as good as won to the benefit of Japan. Over half of the Russian ships which
                     are in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">East Asia</span> have already been destroyed or at least have been incapacitated. Part of the other
                     half are in the port

                     to combat Japan. Therefore, those ships will have to stay in the port and wait until
                     Japan arrives to destroy the battle ships left.

                     The Japanese military showed their understanding of warfare, they proved courage and
                     initiative. As eyewitnesses report, Japanese bullets and cannons always fired their
                     shot and landed it as well, while the Russian projectiles 
                     didn’t even hit their target once. - The start of the Russian-Japanese war seems similar
                     to the start of the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12583" target="_blank">Spanish-American war</a> some time ago. 
                     Back then, the first battle also happened on the ocean, the American admiral <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person036" target="_blank"><em>Dewey</em> [George]</a></span> destroyed the entire Spanish marine in front of the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Philippines</span> 
                     in one night and steered the war into the direction of the American victory. The Japanese-Russian
                     war seems to go along these lines as well. Because of these first victories Japan
                     managed to prevent the Russian marines from 
                     reaching Korea and marching into <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> from there. The first battles on land will probably occur in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span> or at the border to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> and as it seems, 
                     Japan will win. They are better prepared and show more courage. The Russians on the
                     other hand have lost some of their courage after the first <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="anchor-pb"></span><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="pb" source=""></span>losses and lost courage don’t fare well on the battlefield. When the troops fall,
                     
                     they will fall.

                     commanding the Japanese ships. If this is true, the admiration of the Japanese might
                     is unwarranted as the English marine is the best in the world.

                     More news followed the first Japanese victories.
                     <br  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar"></br>The first message was fetched from a Russian gazette in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Petersburg</span>, which reported on a telegram sent by admiral <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Alekseyev [Yevgeni Ivanovich]</span> - the Russian govenor in Asia - to the

                     <br  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar"></br>“I have to inform about Japanese torpedo ships (ships that are tasked with destroying
                     the enemy’s fleet) that were ambushing Russian war ships which were leaving the harbour
                     of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Port Arthur</span>. During this attack

                     That is how the first message from the war side is written. One could imagine that
                     if the Russian admiral delivered this telegram, the Russian loss must have been more
                     severe as he has let on, as later sources described. The Japanese attacked 
                     worked so well: the Russian battle ships shot back, but did not hit their targets
                     and did not damage the Japanese. To caluclate the losses, it is important to understand
                     what it means when an armed battle ship gets destroyed. Generally, an 
                     armed battle ship is to be understood as an <em>entire army corps</em>. A battle ship is worth 20 million. As Russia lost three battle ships during the
                     first attack, it amounts to three corps and 60 million. Furthermore, 
                     the loss of a ship is even greater, as building a ship like this takes years and years
                     and the damage cannot be restored.

                     All of Russia was shocked by the news of the first loss. The tsar’s ball has been
                     cancelled because of it. The Russian stock plunged, the Russian enemies had a party,
                     their allies grieved alongside them - but soon a new message about the 
                     second Russian loss, which was even worse than the first one, was received.

                     and left the harbour. 
                     Two officers and 54 soldiers are wounded, 10 soldiers have been killed. The Russian

                     This is how the governor delivered the news, and everyone can therefore be certain
                     that the Russian loss has been much worse. Again, four battleships were damaged, the
                     fortress suffered. The second defeat was even worse than the first one.

At sea, next to the bay of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Chemulp'o</span>, Russian and Japanese battleships went into battle. Japan demolished the battleships,

                     were able to save themselves, but in turn they were captured by Japan. The Japanese
                     battleships have only been slightly damaged. According to the latest news, Japan managed
                     to stop the Manchurian train and destroy it. This is another big

                  The causes of the war.
                  
                  <p id="p__9" class="yes-index">
                     The war between Russia and Japan broke out mainly because of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. Meaning, Russia and Japan are not at war because of their own countries, but because
                     of foreign ones. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span> is a 
                     small country, amassing 218,650 square kilometres with 10 million inhabitants. Those
                     inhabitants are great fanatics, lazy, half-asleep and live like their ancestors a
                     hundred years ago. The ruler of the country calls himself an “emperor”, but is in
                     reality a 
                     man without courage or power; foreign ambassadors do whatever they want. He is controlled
                     by the Russian ambassador as well as the Japanese, the English and the American one,
                     and even by women. A Russian cook and an English governess influence him greatly.
                     
                     He just lets it all happen. Up until 10 years ago, China had the biggest authority
                     in Korea, formally it belonged to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">China</span>. Because of Korea, the last Chinese-Japanese war, where Japan emerged as victor,
                     broke out as well. Back then, 
                     Japan wanted to take all of Korea, but the allied powers of Germany, Russia, and France
                     interfered and forced Japan to acknowledge <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span> as an independent state - not part of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">China</span>, not part of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Japan</span>. 
                     However, Japan needs Korea because of trade, it needs to settle their merchants there.
                     After the war, Russia started to invade Korea and to cause problems for Japan causing
                     the Russian-Japanese relationship to be strained and irritated.

                  <p id="p__13" class="yes-index">
                     After the last uprising in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">China</span>, the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q150229" target="_blank">Boxer Rebellion</a>, where the “Boxers” rose up against foreigners, every country sent their military
                     there to suppress the rebellion. 
                     After the situation calmed down, everyone’s military retreated, except for Russia,
                     which stayed in the Chinese province of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. Russia occupied this region during the rebellion and refused to retreat. At first,
                     it was looking 
                     for different excused, but the other <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="anchor-pb"></span><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="pb" source=""></span> governments demanded Russia to vacate the area - after that Russia forced China to
                     enter in an agreement after which Russia is allowed to keep occupying the province
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuaria</span> as long as it wants to.

                     of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>, Russia became a closer neighbour to Korea, which bothered Japan quite a lot. But
                     also other governments are not 
                     satisfied with this situation, mainly England and America, which are interested in
                     <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> because of trade. Therefore, they put stones in Russia’s path and disrupted their
                     trading. They wanted to close every Manchurian harbours for 
                     foreign trade. Still, China went into agreement with several other governments allowing
                     them to trade however much they want. England and America therefore drove Japan continuously
                     to not let Russia fob them off. And Japan, who could be sure that it had two 
                     big powers backing them up, demanded of Russia to relinquish any Korean influence
                     and vacate <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. The negotiations dragged on for months. Russia agreed to give up influence on Korea,
                     but not to leave <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> - 
                     but Japan demanded both.

                     Lately, Russia started to prepare for war in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Asia</span>. Japan on the other side, also braced themselves for war. After a while, Japan realised

                     only playing

                     which means the mountain erupts fire. The climate there is healthy: in the summer
                     there is a warm and moist south wind, in the winter it is cold, 
                     harsh north wind. The population grows continuously. Each year it grows by 1/9. Every
                     year, there are 350,000 marriages and 100,000 divorces. Each year over one million
                     children are being born while 800,000 people die. Japan has a lot of big cities, for
                     example 
                     the capital, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tokyo</em></span> with 1,350,000 inhabitants, Osaka - 500,000, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Kyoto</span> - 340,000, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Nogoya</span> - 250,000, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Taiwan</span> - 240,000, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Kōbe</span> - 200,000,

                     speak the same language, wear the same clothes, practise the same customs and religion.
                     Concerning their looks, they are similar to Mongols. The men’s 
                     average height is 158 cm and women’s 145 cm, their skin tone is of a light yellow,
                     their hair is black as well as thick and strong, but their facial hair thin and weak.
                     Some time ago they used to wear plaits like the Chinese, but since they got more civilised
                     
                     they cut them off. The Japanese are known  are known for their cleanliness, they are kind, decent, and polite. Their children
                     respect and honour their parents. There are several schools and a university in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Japan</span>, where Hebrew is taught 
                     as well. Over 800 newspapers and bulletins are published there. The press law is very
                     strict. The Japanese people lead a moderate lifestyle, they mostly eat rice, millet,
                     fish and similar, but not a lot of meat. Their clothes are made of linen, their houses
                     are 
                     lowly built and made out of wood, and the roofs are made out of shingles or covered
                     with straw - very rarely bricks are used. As the houses are built very closely next
                     to each other, fires can spread quickly. - Most Japanese live off of farming, livestock
                     breeding, 
                     and mining. As of recently, factories were being built which export their merchandise
                     abroad. The arts are rather developed, Japanese paper, porcelain, and paintings are
                     known all over the globe.

In the thirteenth century - according to the Gregorian calendar - 
                     the principality of <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130875" target="_blank">Hohenstauffen</a> ruled in this city. The city was surrounded with high walls and moats and the royal
                     palace is situated on a beautiful hill.  At this time the principality ruled over
                     
                     the whole land because one prince was the brother in law of the Roman emperor [<span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Frederick II</span>] - the ruler of Germany at that time. The German peoples were dissatisfied with their
                     sovereign and were said to have 
                     planned a rebellion. In 1285, the Count <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">[Eberhard I] of Wittenberg</span> started a rebellion in order to dispose of Emperor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rudolf [I]</span>, but Rudolf forcefully suppressed the rebellion with his military.

                     The Jewish people in  were valued at that time and have been protected by the prince against the masses,
                     which used to attack the Jewish people a lot. The clergyman incited 
                     violence against the Jewish people. The principality was short on money and borrowed
                     funds from the rich Jewish people leading to the principality protecting the Jewish
                     people and letting no harm happen to 
                     them. The principality therefore issued rights and privileges, forbidding anyone to
                     do harm as they were the prince’s subjects.

                     the order in the country, everyone did whatever

                     on his head was a sable-hat, and in his hand he held a sceptre with a silver top.

                     is aware how to pursue. Additionally, he was very furious as I was not giving him
                     my only daughter for a wife. Three years ago he left my house and his faith and became
                     the leader of the enemies 
                     of Israel. Therefore, he certainly arrived at the royal court to destroy me and the
                     whole community with it. That is what I am scared of. I will soon go to the prince
                     and see whether my fear is justified.”
