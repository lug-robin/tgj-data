                           <p>“One could almost laugh about it, if it wasn’t so sad”... We can justifiably use this
                              general idiom in regards to the religious education at our public schools when accusing
                              our advanced Jewish people 
                              that our religious education is substantially neglected. Our children grow up without
                              a Jewish consciousness concerning religion and faith, they do not know anything about
                              the Jewry, about Jewish celebrations, 
                              or about Jewish music. The educated Jewry then points to the religious education in
                              the schools, that a religious educator is employed in every school who is paid by
                              the Jewish community, that a representative 
                              of the Jewish community sits in the local education authority, that according to the
                              law the religious education is crucial in education. A student might be perfectly
                              educated, but if he doesn’t know about 
                              religion he will not pass the exam - because of all of that they know that the religious
                              education is esteemed and highly renowned and everything is to be done in order to
                              educate the children religiously. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>All of those responses are correct. We have religious educators in every school -
                              but nobody asks what kind of educators they are? We have representatives in the local
                              education authorities, but nobody asks 
                              how concerned they are with our religious inquiries? - The Jewish communities pay
                              the teacher, but nobody asks how they care about the religious education? - The religious
                              education is a significant subject 
                              for every Jewish pupil, but nobody asks if it really happened that a Jewish student
                              failed an exam because he didn’t know anything about religion?
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The answer is: religious education in schools is a serious subject, but is not taught
                              seriously. We don’t want to use a harsher expression, otherwise we would have to say:
                              it is treated like a joke.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The religious educator is for the most part not really pious. The children realise
                              that he thinks little of religion and what he teaches. Therefore, the religious education
                              doesn’t leave a big impression, 
                              they don’t take it seriously and take religion solely as a story, which they don’t
                              have to know anything about, like other historical chronicles. There isn’t really
                              an alternative; for the most part they 
                              are in school ignoring the Sabbath to learn writing, calculating and similar - how
                              should they think about the Sabbath as honourable? And if the religious educator is
                              a serious man, as those educators really 
                              are, then he has a serious challenge with children of non-pious parents. For example,
                              if he learns in school that eating <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1060878" target="_blank">Chametz</a> is not allowed during 
                              <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q121393" target="_blank">Passover</a> - and that child goes home and eats Chametz , then goes back to school and explains
                              that the teacher lied about Chametz not being forbidden 
                              to eat .The same happens with the Sabbath observance and other big customs of the
                              Jewish religion.
                              </p>

                              But if a teacher who wants to take a stance against that and wants to convince the
                              children that the religion he teaches is the true Jewry - then a fight against him
                              rises. He gets reported to the Local 
                              Education Administration, an investigation against him gets instigated and he is</p>

                           <p>being assaulted until he shuts up and is quiet.                
                              </p>

                              However, a Jewish representative sits in the Local Education Administration, who should
                              take on the teacher, because doesn’t he sit there for exactly that reason? You will
                              of course ask, but that is indeed a bad 
                              thing. The Jewish school inspector wants to demonstrate that he is a modern man, not
                              a fanatic and only cares about the religion teacher if pious parents complain that
                              the lessons are bad. But he will remain quiet 
                              if someone complains that the teacher is too pious (usually a lawyer or a doctor or
                              similar who has little knowledge of religion and is hardly pious), nobody should think
                              only he is a “fanatic” under no circumstances…

                              We want to bring facts which have been created in a big jewish community here in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span>.

                              A Jewish religious educator who came to the knowledge that Jewish students are sitting
                              in school on Sabbath, asked the director he shall free the children from writing on
                              Sabbath, as the law does allow that. The director sent 
                              this inquiry to the LEA, which sent it to the board of the religious community, if
                              writing on Sabbath is indeed prohibited. This inquiry has had an answer from the religious
                              board for a few months now. They do not have the audacity 
                              to say they should be writing; to say no on the other shames him, in case someone
                              might say the board are fanatics!... We think that it is a bigger shame to be silent
                              about this for so long.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>A second case happened in the same city: A Jewish teacher talked about the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q837443" target="_blank">Law of Moses</a>, the children reported this at home, some pious Jewish people told the school 
                              inspector and he initiated an investigation and interrogated the children as witnesses.
                              The Jewish doctor who is the representative in the LEA, who should have been most
                              angered about the Jewish teacher, helped her and wanted 
                              to twist the children's answers with various questions in order to make several pull
                              back their statements. He didn't achieve this, but this case shows how far the interests
                              of the Jewish representatives in the LEA go for the Jewish religion.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Are those two tales proof enough, or should we describe more stories? - We don’t think
                              that as necessary: every Jewish reader knows stories like this of their own experience.
                              There are very little or even no Jewish religious 
                              educators who are not complained about and there are few schools where stories like
                              this don’t circulate.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              However, we can say that the education in school according to the required methods,
                              doesn’t get to the children. They stay unfamiliar with religion, its people and their
                              faith.

                              The Hungarian Jews, their lives, their political and economical situation, are not
                              really known to our Jewish readers. The Hungarian Jew is a different “type”, he differs
                              from the Polish and the German ones. 
                              They live miles apart and don’t come in contact with each other. I’m not looking to
                              describe Hungarian Jewish people in detail, their situation, their conditions and
                              their states. I will do that in another

                              and others.
                              Together they would be the majority in the whole populace and the Magyars do know
                              that if all those tribes get together, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> would not be a Magyarianian state, nor a Slavish one. 
                              Therefore they strive to strengthen the Magyarian populace, suppress the other nationalities,
                              refuse them their national pride and don’t let them develop their national interests.
                              The Jewish people in

                              the government has always got massive support during elections in the cities, where
                              many Jewish 
                              people live among Romanians and Slavic people. Without Jewish people, Slavic people
                              would have been elected into the government. Where few Hungarians live, Jewish people
                              help Hungarians to a successful election.

                           <p>
                              Furthermore, the Jewish people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> can influence the government in certain ways and if they want something, they have
                              the power to do so. Still, there have been some cases where the 
                              government issued laws, which harmed Jewish people there. The last minister president
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person034" target="_blank">Kálmán Széll</a></span> allowed Christians to open shops and banks in frontier districts where a lot of Jewish
                              
                              people live among Ruthenians and Slavs in order to support the populace there. That
                              harmed the Jewish people there. As soon as they opposed it, the government had to
                              stop. Jewish people seem to have a bit more 
                              influence in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> compared to other countries.

                           <p>
                              This influence also proved useful in the case of the Sunday rest. Many pious Jewish
                              people, especially in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span>, suffer under the law of Sunday Rest. They close their shop on Sabbath 
                              and also have to do so on Sunday. Closing their stores two days a week is difficult,
                              especially for the little merchant. The Hungarian Jewish people managed to achieve
                              some relief.

                              A few months ago, the government issued a decree for every tobacco shop to be open
                              for business on Sabbath. The licence is to be revoked of those who keep it closed
                              on Sabbath. This decree has been a 
                              serious “punishment”. Several tobacconists, who didn’t want their licence to be revoked,
                              and have therefore violated Sabbath. However, many pious Jewish people insisted and
                              have not lost their livelihood over 
                              this. The Jewish people have raised tumult: they have handed over petitions to the
                              finance minister. Last week he gave confirmation to the chancellery of Orthodox Jews
                              in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place030" target="_blank">Budapest</a></span> that he meets half of their 
                              demands. That means: he issued another decree that those who ran their shops before
                              the previous decree may close their shops on Sabbath. And those who have had their
                              licences revoked, will get it back. Still, 
                              tobacconists who get their licence now have to vow to keep their shop open on Sabbath.
                              In other words, pious Jewish people cannot open tobacco shops anymore…
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The minister has already written to the chancellery that he cannot back down anymore
                              and they cannot ask for more. However, the pious Jewish people of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> must not remain silent and have to use all means
                              at their disposal to abolish the rest of this punishment. If the government doesn’t
                              want to give in, they have to turn to the parliament. And if that doesn’t help as
                              well they have to submit to our Lord, 
                              King … and they will hopefully achieve everything. 
                              </p>

                              Jewish people have made Romanians and Slavs their enemies because they have always
                              supported the government! In those places where a lot of Slavs live there is a great
                              hostility between them and the Jewish 
                              people there which leads to fights and brawls. I do not want to judge whether the
                              Jewish people gain advantages for themselves by being devoted to the Magyars and therefore
                              make enemies with the other peoples. 
                              Maybe it would have been better for the Jewish people to stay neutral and not form
                              alliances with any other nationality. I want to write about that another time. The
                              Jewish people are already suffering because 
                              they support the government and should therefore not make them suffer more. However,
                              if the government forgets their duty, the Jewish people need to remind them as long
                              as they are listened to.

Both have hesitated a long time, waiting for the other
                              
                              one to start the one so as to not bear the responsibility of inaugurating it.  Finally, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> lost its patience and called back their ambassador from <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place018" target="_blank">St Petersburg</a></span> 
                              immediately leading to war. The first few days, news from Japanese victories at sea
                              have been received. If <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> beats <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> at sea, the war will continue on the mainland. 
                              It is not clear yet how exactly both armies will crash against each other. First of
                              all, no one knows how fast both want to reach the capital of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a></span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place071" target="_blank">Seoul</a></span>. It’s therefore possible that the first war on land will be happening 
                              in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a></span>. If <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> gets to occupy <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a></span> before the Russian military manages to get there, both enemies will already meet
                              at the border of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a></span>. The 
                              Japanese military plans to invade <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a></span> in order to split the Russian military into two parts and weaken their forces. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> moves particularly cautiously to invade <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a></span> 
                              in secret. They want to destroy Russian connections to their country, to demolish
                              their railroads and cut their supply stream of food and war materials in order to
                              facilitate the Japanese victory in the end.

                              News of the first Japanese victories impressed the whole world, therefore leading
                              to hope it would be easier for <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> to make peace. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> will be content with their first 
                              victories and would be inclined to make peace sooner. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> was also scared of the war before it broke out and will certainly give in. Different
                              sources talk about peace enforcement. Some say the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person035" target="_blank">Pope</a></span> 
                              will be the “mediator”, others talk about our <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person003" target="_blank">Emperor Franz Josef</a></span> being an arbitrator, but for now nothing of that is true. No one so far has come
                              forward to mediate and nobody wants to. - Every government declared themselves 
                              as “neutral”, meaning they are not supporting any party and just want to watch. Except
                              for England, they support <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> in secret. There is a rumour that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place011" target="_blank">England</a></span> won’t let Russian

                              get money.

                              No one can say for sure how long the war will last, but it seems like it will end
                              soon. A long war, which will not be cheap for <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span>, will cause revolutions inside the country. Rumour has it there are preparations
                              
                              for a revolution in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place076" target="_blank">Russian Poland</a></span> already. Therefore, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> needs to end the war soon to keep its own country in check. The idiom: “The camel
                              wanted horns, but cut off the ears as well” became 
                              true for Russia now. Russia wanted </p>

                              The whole world is now curious how this war will end - if <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> or <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> will emerge as victor. Never before has everyone been so invested in a war, which
                              is happening in a 
                              faraway country. Neither the war between <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place021" target="_blank">China</a></span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> ten years ago nor the war between <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place043" target="_blank">Spain</a></span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place094" target="_blank">America</a></span> 
                              five years ago was in everyone’s mind like that because the end result was not important
                              for the whole world. However, now, it is of great importance. If <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> loses, its power will be forever broken, the dissatisfaction

Either <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> has to issue a constitution and stop the tyrannical reign or revolutions will reign
                              through the whole country and bring it to ruins. If <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span>

Then, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a></span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place040" target="_blank">Italy</a></span> also need to intervene, therefore developing the war into a

                              An important question now is the significance the Russian-Japanese war has in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a></span>.

                              There is another reason why <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a></span> is interested in the Russian-Japanese War.

                              The European powers did not let something bad happen to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place089" target="_blank">Greece</a></span>.

However, since the revolution against

                              Until now, every Balkan country was afraid to declare war on <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a></span>, because <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a></span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> warned 
                              them not to start as they don’t want the situation in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a></span> to change. But now, as <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> is occupied in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place024" target="_blank">Asia</a></span>, the question is whether the 
                              Balkan countries prepare for war. News came via telegram that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a></span> needs to convene their reservists and prepare in case a war breaks out in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a></span>. - 
                              The Russo-Japanese war can therefore have set off another war which is of great interest
                              to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a></span> as well as the whole world. - Besides, the whole world is greatly interested in the

                              days of war. The first losses have shown that the Russian marines are not able to
                              oppose the Japanese one on the water making one think the 
                              war is as good as won to the benefit of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span>.

The other part is

Therefore, those ships will have to stay in the port and wait until <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> arrives to destroy the battle ships left.

                              The Japanese military showed their understanding of warfare, they proved courage and
                              initiative. As eyewitnesses report, Japanese bullets and cannons always fired their
                              shot and landed it as well, while the Russian projectiles didn’t even hit their target
                              once. - The start of the 
                              Russo-Japanese war seems similar to the start of the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12583" target="_blank">Spanish-American war</a> some time ago. Back then, the first battle also happened on the ocean, the American
                              admiral <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person036" target="_blank"><em>Dewey</em></a></span> 
                              destroyed the entire Spanish marine in front of the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place084" target="_blank">Philippines</a></span> in one night and steered the war into the direction of the American victory. The
                              Russo-Japanese war seems to go along these lines as well. Because of these first victories
                              
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> managed to prevent the Russian marines from reaching <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a></span> and marching into <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a></span> from there. The first battles on 
                              land will probably occur in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a></span> or at the border to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a></span> and as it seems, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> will win. They are better prepared and show 
                              more courage. The Russians on the other hand have lost some of their courage after
                              the first losses and lost courage don’t fare well on the battlefield. When the troops
                              fall, they will fall.

It is known that the Japanese military training is highly advanced and
                              they have proven great strength. However, rumour has it that there are <em>English officers</em>
                              on the ships who are dressed like the Japanese as to not be recognised and they are
                              commanding the Japanese ships. If this is true, the admiration of the Japanese might
                              is unwarranted as the English marine is the best in the world.

                              “I have to inform about Japanese torpedo ships (ships that are tasked with destroying
                              the enemy’s fleet) that were ambushing Russian war ships which were leaving the harbour
                              of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place083" target="_blank">Port Arthur</a></span>. During this attack   <em>three ironclads have

                              That is how the first message from the war side is written. One could imagine that
                              if the Russian admiral delivered this telegram, the Russian loss must have been more
                              severe as he has let on, as later sources described. The Japanese attacked worked
                              so well: the Russian battle ships shot back, but 
                              did not hit their targets and did not damage the Japanese. To caluclate the losses,
                              it is important to understand what it means when an armed battle ship gets destroyed.
                              Generally, an armed battle ship is to be understood as an <em>entire army corps</em>. A battle ship is worth 20 million. 
                              As <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> lost three battle ships during the first attack, it amounts to three corps and 60
                              million. Furthermore, the loss of a ship is even greater, as building a ship like
                              this takes years and years and the damage cannot be restored.
                              </p>

The Russian stock plunged, the Russian enemies
                              had a party, their allies grieved alongside them - 
                              but soon a new message about the second Russian loss, which was even worse than the
                              first one, was received.

We shot back from the fortress. After one hour, the Japanese stopped firing arms
                              and left the harbour. Two officers and 54 soldiers are wounded, 
                              10 soldiers have been killed. The Russian battle ships “Poltava”, “Diana”, “Askold”,

                              that the Russian loss has been much worse. Again, four battleships were damaged, the
                              fortress suffered. The second defeat was even worse than the first one.

                              The third Japanese victory is also being reported on.

Most of the crew 
                              were able to save themselves, but in turn they were captured by <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span>. The Japanese battleships have only been slightly damaged. According to the latest

                              This is another big win as the Russian military deliveries are interrupted.

                              calls himself an “emperor”, but is in reality a man without courage or power; foreign

There are several high mountains and even volcanoes,

                              there is a warm and moist south wind, in the winter it is cold, harsh north wind.
                              The population grows continuously. 
                              Each year it grows by 1/9. Every year, there are 350,000 marriages and 100,000 divorces.

They
                              speak the same language, wear the same clothes, practise the same customs and religion.
                              Concerning their looks, they are similar to Mongols. The men’s average height is 158
                              cm and women’s 
                              145 cm, their skin tone is of a light yellow, their hair is black as well as thick
                              and strong, but their facial hair thin and weak. Some time ago they used to wear plaits
                              like the Chinese, but since they got more civilised they cut them off. The Japanese
                              are known  are known for their cleanliness, they are kind, decent, and polite. 
                              Their children respect and honour their parents. There are several schools and a university
                              in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span>, where Hebrew is taught as well. Over 800 newspapers and bulletins are published
                              there. The press law is very strict. The Japanese people lead a moderate lifestyle,
                              they mostly eat rice, 
                              millet, fish and similar, but not a lot of meat. Their clothes are made of linen,
                              their houses are lowly built and made out of wood, and the roofs are made out of shingles
                              or covered with straw - very rarely bricks are used. As the houses are built very
                              closely next to each other, fires can spread quickly. - Most Japanese live off of
                              
                              farming, livestock breeding, and mining. As of recently, factories were being built
                              which export their merchandise abroad. The arts are rather developed, Japanese paper,
                              porcelain, and paintings are known all over the globe.

                              This story we are telling here is historically true and happened in the old city of
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a></span> in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a></span>. In the thirteenth century - according to the Gregorian calendar - 
                              the principality of <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130875" target="_blank">Hohenstauffen</a> ruled in this city. The city was surrounded with high walls and moats and the royal
                              palace is situated on a beautiful hill.  At this time the principality ruled over
                              
                              the whole land because one prince was the brother in law of the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person043" target="_blank">Roman emperor</a></span> - the ruler of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a></span> at that time. The German peoples were dissatisfied with their sovereign and were
                              said to have 
                              planned a rebellion. In <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">1285</span>, the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person044" target="_blank">Count of Württemberg</a></span> started a rebellion in order to dispose of Emperor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person045" target="_blank">Rudolf</a></span>, 
                              but <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person045" target="_blank">Rudolf</a></span> forcefully suppressed the rebellion with his military.

                              The Jewish people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a></span> were valued at that time and have been protected by the prince against the masses,
                              which used to attack the Jewish people a lot. The clergyman incited 
                              violence against the Jewish people. The principality was short on money and borrowed
                              funds from the rich Jewish people leading to the principality protecting the Jewish
                              people and letting no harm happen to them. The principality therefore issued rights
                              and privileges, forbidding anyone to do harm as they were the prince’s subjects.

                              At that time, there was a Rabbi in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a></span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person046" target="_blank">Rabbi <em>Meir</em></a></span> of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="" target="_blank"><a href="place047" target="_blank">Worms</a></a></span> - may his memory be a blessing. An important gaon, who spread 
                              the light of the Torah across the whole country. He was also a knowledgeable scholar
                              in various sciences and asked every important question for advice. He led his community
                              with knowledge and in godliness. He was well-known in all of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a></span>, from all sides he was asked 
                              questions to receive the answers and what he said was accepted. He was so popular
                              that he was just called “<span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person046" target="_blank">Meir of Rothenburg</a></span>”. He also led a yeshiva where students from all around came to study under him.

                              As the prince of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a></span> heard how popular the Rabbi of his city was, he was delighted how prominent his city
                              had become. He held the Rabbi in high regard and consulted 
                              with him on various political questions as well as admired the intelligence and reasoning
                              of the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person046" target="_blank">Meir</a></span> of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a></span>.

                              Only as the rebellion against Emperor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person045" target="_blank">Rudolf</a></span> broke out did the situation of the Jewish community deteriorate. The rebellion disturbed
                              the order in the country, everyone did whatever they wanted, ignored the law, and
                              stole one another’s money - and 
                              everybody put the blame on the Jewish people to consume the funds.

The rabbi has always
                              - as he was an old man already - looked well, went upright, was neither bent nor broken.
                              Therefore, everyone admired him, but 
                              immediately saw that he looked anxious and sick. He was dressed in his silken long
                              coat, with a silken belt - both dropped down to his feet - on his head was a sable-hat,
                              and in his hand he held a sceptre with a silver top. It was noticeable that he wanted
                              to go somewhere.

                              A young student stood next to the table with great respect, but he could not hold
                              himself back as he saw his frightened Rabbi and asked with quiet voice:
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              “What worries you? I ask of you, my dear Rabbi, tell me why you are so scared and
                              unhappy? I am not used to seeing you distressed like this. Forgive me, dearest Rabbi,
                              that I dare to question you today. 
                              But I am aware that you told me all your secrets as your student, so why do you remain
                              silent today? It is not the first time you have been called to the prince, who holds
                              you in high respect and always 
                              welcomes you with mercy and grace. Why then are you so distressed?!

                           <p>
                              “You are right, my dearest!” answered <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person046" target="_blank">Meir</a></span>. Those who are confident do not need to be sad. However, I have been plagued by several
                              fears. I think the good times for us Jews in

Our sun is setting and the darkest night

                              The student was perplexed.

                              and in the bordering countries?” The <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person046" target="_blank">Meir</a></span> asked him. “Did you forget the hardship under which our brothers suffered? Not only
                              three years have gone by since the mob attacked 
                              our brothers in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place046" target="_blank">Mainz</a></span> and burnt them.

                              and all Jewish people have been thrown into the fire afterwards - A messenger from
                              the city of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal"><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place105" target="_blank">Oberwesel</a></span> arrived yesterday and bore a horrible announcement: the clergymen there 
                              defamed the Jewish people there having slaughtered a Christian child in order to sacrifice
                              its blood for an offering. The clergymen set the people against the Jewish people
                              with this false accusation which are scared of being 
                              outside now. If this slander is now believed by the mobs, then heaven help us, massive
                              hardship will come over Jewish people. Now, a rebellion broke out in the country,
                              the revolutionists are not far from our lands. Wherever 
                              they go, they will unleash all of their wrath upon the Jewish people… This grim situation saddens me and I am very afraid why the

                           <p>
                              “Why my dearest Rabbi, are you afraid and forgot that God - praise the Lord - the

                              And the Rabbi continued: “For some years already, this evildoer has been following
                              us wherever we go. Every false accusation, every defamation, every evil law, every
                              persecution stems from him. His 
                              roots go back to us, but he is our greatest enemy. In his youth, he has studied under
                              me, I raised him; but now he has turned his back and has become evil. He knows the
                              Jewish ways and                
                              is aware how to pursue. Additionally, he was very furious as I was not giving him
                              my only daughter for a wife. Three years ago he left my house and his faith and became
                              the leader of the enemies 
                              of Israel. Therefore, he certainly arrived at the royal court to destroy me and the
                              whole community with it. That is what I am scared of. I will soon go to the prince
                              and see whether my fear is justified.”
