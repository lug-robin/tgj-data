                           <p>“One could almost laugh about it, if it wasn’t so sad”... We can justifiably use this
                              general idiom in regards to the religious education at our public schools when accusing
                              our advanced Jewish people 
                              that our religious education is substantially neglected. Our children grow up without
                              a Jewish consciousness concerning religion and faith, they do not know anything about
                              the Jewry, about Jewish celebrations, 
                              or about Jewish music. The educated Jewry then points to the religious education in
                              the schools, that a religious educator is employed in every school who is paid by
                              the Jewish community, that a representative 
                              of the Jewish community sits in the local education authority, that according to the
                              law the religious education is crucial in education. A student might be perfectly
                              educated, but if he doesn’t know about 
                              religion he will not pass the exam - because of all of that they know that the religious
                              education is esteemed and highly renowned and everything is to be done in order to
                              educate the children religiously. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>All of those responses are correct. We have religious educators in every school -
                              but nobody asks what kind of educators they are? We have representatives in the local
                              education authorities, but nobody asks 
                              how concerned they are with our religious inquiries? - The Jewish communities pay
                              the teacher, but nobody asks how they care about the religious education? - The religious
                              education is a significant subject 
                              for every Jewish pupil, but nobody asks if it really happened that a Jewish student
                              failed an exam because he didn’t know anything about religion?
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The answer is: religious education in schools is a serious subject, but is not taught
                              seriously. We don’t want to use a harsher expression, otherwise we would have to say:
                              it is treated like a joke.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The religious educator is for the most part not really pious. The children realise
                              that he thinks little of religion and what he teaches. Therefore, the religious education
                              doesn’t leave a big impression, 
                              they don’t take it seriously and take religion solely as a story, which they don’t
                              have to know anything about, like other historical chronicles. There isn’t really
                              an alternative; for the most part they 
                              are in school ignoring the Sabbath to learn writing, calculating and similar - how
                              should they think about the Sabbath as honourable? And if the religious educator is
                              a serious man, as those educators really 
                              are, then he has a serious challenge with children of non-pious parents. For example,
                              if he learns in school that eating <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1060878" target="_blank">Chametz</a> is not allowed during 
                              <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q121393" target="_blank">Passover</a> - and that child goes home and eats Chametz , then goes back to school and explains
                              that the teacher lied about Chametz not being forbidden 
                              to eat .The same happens with the Sabbath observance and other big customs of the
                              Jewish religion.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              But if a teacher who wants to take a stance against that and wants to convince the
                              children that the religion he teaches is the true Jewry - then a fight against him
                              rises. He gets reported to the Local 
                              Education Administration, an investigation against him gets instigated and he is</p>

                              However, a Jewish representative sits in the Local Education Administration, who should
                              take on the teacher, because doesn’t he sit there for exactly that reason? You will
                              of course ask, but that is indeed a bad 
                              thing. The Jewish school inspector wants to demonstrate that he is a modern man, not
                              a fanatic and only cares about the religion teacher if pious parents complain that
                              the lessons are bad. But he will remain quiet 
                              if someone complains that the teacher is too pious (usually a lawyer or a doctor or
                              similar who has little knowledge of religion and is hardly pious), nobody should think
                              only he is a “fanatic” under no circumstances…

                              Not that anyone now thinks we are telling fairy tales, that we are suspected of lies.
                              We want to bring facts which have been created in a big jewish community here in <a href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a>.

                              A Jewish religious educator who came to the knowledge that Jewish students are sitting
                              in school on Sabbath, asked the director he shall free the children from writing on
                              Sabbath, as the law does allow that. The director sent 
                              this inquiry to the LEA, which sent it to the board of the religious community, if
                              writing on Sabbath is indeed prohibited. This inquiry has had an answer from the religious
                              board for a few months now. They do not have the audacity 
                              to say they should be writing; to say no on the other shames him, in case someone
                              might say the board are fanatics!... We think that it is a bigger shame to be silent
                              about this for so long.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>A second case happened in the same city: A Jewish teacher talked about the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q837443" target="_blank">Law of Moses</a>, the children reported this at home, some pious Jewish people told the school 
                              inspector and he initiated an investigation and interrogated the children as witnesses.
                              The Jewish doctor who is the representative in the LEA, who should have been most
                              angered about the Jewish teacher, helped her and wanted 
                              to twist the children's answers with various questions in order to make several pull
                              back their statements. He didn't achieve this, but this case shows how far the interests
                              of the Jewish representatives in the LEA go for the Jewish religion.
                              </p>

                              Are those two tales proof enough, or should we describe more stories? - We don’t think
                              that as necessary: every Jewish reader knows stories like this of their own experience.
                              There are very little or even no Jewish religious 
                              educators who are not complained about and there are few schools where stories like
                              this don’t circulate.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              However, we can say that the education in school according to the required methods,
                              doesn’t get to the children. They stay unfamiliar with religion, its people and their
                              faith.

                              The Hungarian Jews, their lives, their political and economical situation, are not
                              really known to our Jewish readers. The Hungarian Jew is a different “type”, he differs
                              from the Polish and the German ones. 
                              They live miles apart and don’t come in contact with each other. I’m not looking to
                              describe Hungarian Jewish people in detail, their situation, their conditions and
                              their states. I will do that in another 
                              letter. I just want to share important information which will interest every Jew.

                              In <a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a> live - beside <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q133032" target="_blank">Magyars</a> - several other tribes, like Germans, Romanians, Slowakians, Croatians, Ruthenians
                              and others.
                              Together they would be the majority in the whole populace and the Magyars do know
                              that if all those tribes get together, <a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a> would not be a Magyarianian state, nor a Slavish one. 
                              Therefore they strive to strengthen the Magyarian populace, suppress the other nationalities,
                              refuse them their national pride and don’t let them develop their national interests.
                              The Jewish people in 
                              <a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a> are always loyal to the government, supporting it in every situation and above all,
                              the government has always got massive support during elections in the cities, where
                              many Jewish 
                              people live among Romanians and Slavic people. Without Jewish people, Slavic people
                              would have been elected into the government. Where few Hungarians live, Jewish people
                              help Hungarians to a successful election.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Furthermore, the Jewish people in <a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a> can influence the government in certain ways and if they want something, they have
                              the power to do so. Still, there have been some cases where the 
                              government issued laws, which harmed Jewish people there. The last minister president
                              <a href="person034" target="_blank">Kálmán Széll</a> allowed Christians to open shops and banks in frontier districts where a lot of Jewish
                              
                              people live among Ruthenians and Slavs in order to support the populace there. That
                              harmed the Jewish people there. As soon as they opposed it, the government had to
                              stop. Jewish people seem to have a bit more 
                              influence in <a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a> compared to other countries.

                           <p>
                              This influence also proved useful in the case of the Sunday rest. Many pious Jewish
                              people, especially in <a href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a>, suffer under the law of Sunday Rest. They close their shop on Sabbath 
                              and also have to do so on Sunday. Closing their stores two days a week is difficult,
                              especially for the little merchant. The Hungarian Jewish people managed to achieve
                              some relief.
                              </p>

                              A few months ago, the government issued a decree for every tobacco shop to be open
                              for business on Sabbath. The licence is to be revoked of those who keep it closed
                              on Sabbath. This decree has been a 
                              serious “punishment”. Several tobacconists, who didn’t want their licence to be revoked,
                              and have therefore violated Sabbath. However, many pious Jewish people insisted and
                              have not lost their livelihood over 
                              this. The Jewish people have raised tumult: they have handed over petitions to the
                              finance minister. Last week he gave confirmation to the chancellery of Orthodox Jews
                              in <a href="place030" target="_blank">Budapest</a> that he meets half of their 
                              demands. That means: he issued another decree that those who ran their shops before
                              the previous decree may close their shops on Sabbath. And those who have had their
                              licences revoked, will get it back. Still, 
                              tobacconists who get their licence now have to vow to keep their shop open on Sabbath.
                              In other words, pious Jewish people cannot open tobacco shops anymore…
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The minister has already written to the chancellery that he cannot back down anymore
                              and they cannot ask for more. However, the pious Jewish people of <a href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a> must not remain silent and have to use all means
                              at their disposal to abolish the rest of this punishment. If the government doesn’t
                              want to give in, they have to turn to the parliament. And if that doesn’t help as
                              well they have to submit to our Lord, 
                              King … and they will hopefully achieve everything. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Jewish people have made Romanians and Slavs their enemies because they have always
                              supported the government! In those places where a lot of Slavs live there is a great
                              hostility between them and the Jewish 
                              people there which leads to fights and brawls. I do not want to judge whether the
                              Jewish people gain advantages for themselves by being devoted to the Magyars and therefore
                              make enemies with the other peoples. 
                              Maybe it would have been better for the Jewish people to stay neutral and not form
                              alliances with any other nationality. I want to write about that another time. The
                              Jewish people are already suffering because 
                              they support the government and should therefore not make them suffer more. However,
                              if the government forgets their duty, the Jewish people need to remind them as long
                              as they are listened to.

                              After lengthy negotiation going back and forth, the war between <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> and <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> has ultimately broken out. Both have hesitated a long time, waiting for the other
                              
                              one to start the one so as to not bear the responsibility of inaugurating it.  Finally, <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> lost its patience and called back their ambassador from <a href="place018" target="_blank">St Petersburg</a> 
                              immediately leading to war. The first few days, news from Japanese victories at sea
                              have been received. If <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> beats <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> at sea, the war will continue on the mainland. 
                              It is not clear yet how exactly both armies will crash against each other. First of
                              all, no one knows how fast both want to reach the capital of <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a>, <a href="place071" target="_blank">Seoul</a>. It’s therefore possible that the first war on land will be happening 
                              in <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a>. If <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> gets to occupy <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> before the Russian military manages to get there, both enemies will already meet
                              at the border of <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a>. The 
                              Japanese military plans to invade <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a> in order to split the Russian military into two parts and weaken their forces. <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> moves particularly cautiously to invade <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a> 
                              in secret. They want to destroy Russian connections to their country, to demolish
                              their railroads and cut their supply stream of food and war materials in order to
                              facilitate the Japanese victory in the end.

                              victories and would be inclined to make peace sooner. <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> was also scared of the war before it broke out and will certainly give in. Different
                              sources talk about peace enforcement. Some say the <a href="person035" target="_blank">Pope</a> 
                              will be the “mediator”, others talk about our <a href="person003" target="_blank">Emperor Franz Josef</a> being an arbitrator, but for now nothing of that is true. No one so far has come
                              forward to mediate and nobody wants to. - Every government declared themselves 
                              as “neutral”, meaning they are not supporting any party and just want to watch. Except
                              for England, they support <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> in secret. There is a rumour that <a href="place011" target="_blank">England</a> won’t let Russian 
                              ships pass through the <a href="place072" target="_blank">Mediterranean Sea</a> to <a href="place136" target="_blank">East Asia</a>, through the <a href="place073" target="_blank">Dardanelles</a> or through the <a href="place074" target="_blank">Suez-Canal</a>.

                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> is trying to receive loans, but after the first losses, there are doubts they will

                              No one can say for sure how long the war will last, but it seems like it will end
                              soon. A long war, which will not be cheap for <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>, will cause revolutions inside the country. Rumour has it there are preparations
                              
                              for a revolution in <a href="place076" target="_blank">Russian Poland</a> already. Therefore, <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> needs to end the war soon to keep its own country in check. The idiom: “The camel
                              wanted horns, but cut off the ears as well” became 
                              true for Russia now. Russia wanted </p>

                              to invade foreign countries, but is now busy with its own land.

                              The whole world is now curious how this war will end - if <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> or <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> will emerge as victor. Never before has everyone been so invested in a war, which
                              is happening in a 
                              faraway country. Neither the war between <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a> and <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> ten years ago nor the war between <a href="place043" target="_blank">Spain</a> and <a href="place094" target="_blank">America</a> 
                              five years ago was in everyone’s mind like that because the end result was not important
                              for the whole world. However, now, it is of great importance. If <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> loses, its power will be forever broken, the dissatisfaction 
                              inside the country will grow. Either <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> has to issue a constitution and stop the tyrannical reign or revolutions will reign
                              through the whole country and bring it to ruins. If <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> 
                              loses, the chances to advance into a <em>Worldwar</em> in all of <a href="place100" target="_blank">Europe</a> and <a href="place024" target="_blank">Asia</a> is tremendous. Nobody will support <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> as every country is in conflict with them. 
                              Even their ally, France, is not happy with <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>’s occupation of <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a>. <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> has <a href="place011" target="_blank">England</a> and 
                              <a href="place094" target="_blank">America</a> on their side, as <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> is waging war for them as well. They want the same thing <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> does: for 
                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> to leave <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a>. But if <a href="place011" target="_blank">England</a> and <a href="place094" target="_blank">America</a> support <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a>, 
                              <a href="place045" target="_blank">France</a> will certainly not watch from afar. Then, <a href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a> and <a href="place040" target="_blank">Italy</a> also need to intervene, therefore developing the war into a 
                              world war, for which no one can know how that will end. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              An important question now is the significance the Russian-Japanese war has in <a href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a>. On the outside, <a href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a> and <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> 
                              are at peace, but the differences between those two countries have not ceased to exist.
                              <a href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a> has always been in conflict with <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> about <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> 
                              settling in <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a> and bothering <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> there. <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> can breathe a sigh of relief and act more freely in the <a href="place077" target="_blank">Balkans</a>, now that 
                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> is occupied in <a href="place024" target="_blank">Asia</a>. The time has come for <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> to declare <a href="place124" target="_blank">Bosnia</a> and 
                              <a href="place125" target="_blank">Herzegovina</a> as its own. Until now, those two countries belonged to <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a> while <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> had merely occupied it. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              There is another reason why <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> is interested in the Russian-Japanese War. As is known, <a href="place112" target="_blank">Bulgaria</a> intends to wage war with <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a> for 
                              a while now as <a href="place081" target="_blank">Macedonia</a> belongs to <a href="place112" target="_blank">Bulgaria</a>. Additionally, <a href="place080" target="_blank">Montenegro</a> is also constantly looking to involve 
                              <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a> in a conflict. <a href="place112" target="_blank">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="place080" target="_blank">Montenegro</a> hope to drive <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a> completely out of 
                              <a href="place100" target="_blank">Europe</a>. And if they lose the war, they may take no damage from it like <a href="place089" target="_blank">Greece</a> has taken no damage after losing the war with <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a>. 
                              The European powers did not let something bad happen to <a href="place089" target="_blank">Greece</a>. Even though <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a> has won the war, they had to give up the island <em><a href="place079" target="_blank">Crete</a></em>. 
                              Therefore, <a href="place112" target="_blank">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="place080" target="_blank">Montenegro</a> hope for the Christian powers to interfere in case they lose the war and take <a href="place081" target="_blank">Macedonia</a> away from <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a>. 
                              <a href="place111" target="_blank">Serbia</a> has not wanted to interfere with disputes on the <a href="place077" target="_blank">Balkans</a> as long as <a href="person038" target="_blank">King Aleksandar</a> has ruled. However, since the revolution against 
                              <a href="person038" target="_blank">King Aleksandar</a> and the war of the new king, <a href="person037" target="_blank">King Peter</a>, dissatisfaction has risen in the country. The king has not punished the murder of
                              <a href="person038" target="_blank">King Aleksandar</a> but started a war with 
                              <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a> to quench the discontent in the country.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Until now, every Balkan country was afraid to declare war on <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a>, because <a href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a> and <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> warned 
                              them not to start as they don’t want the situation in <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a> to change. But now, as <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> is occupied in <a href="place024" target="_blank">Asia</a>, the question is whether the 
                              Balkan countries prepare for war. News came via telegram that <a href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a> needs to convene their reservists and prepare in case a war breaks out in <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a>. - 
                              The Russo-Japanese war can therefore have set off another war which is of great interest
                              to <a href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a> as well as the whole world. - Besides, the whole world is greatly interested in the
                              war in 
                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> and expect daily news from the warside.

                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> has already been harshly defeated in three battles on the ocean in the first few
                              days of war. The first losses have shown that the Russian marines are not able to
                              oppose the Japanese one on the water making one think the 
                              war is as good as won to the benefit of <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a>. Over half of the Russian ships which are in <a href="place136" target="_blank">East Asia</a> have already been destroyed or at least have been incapacitated. Part of the 
                              other half are in the port of <em><a href="place082" target="_blank">Vladivostok</a></em> which is frozen over leading to the ships being stuck in there. The other part is
                              stationed in <a href="place083" target="_blank">Port Arthur</a>, this 
                              part alone is not strong enough to combat <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a>. Therefore, those ships will have to stay in the port and wait until <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> arrives to destroy the battle ships left. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The Japanese military showed their understanding of warfare, they proved courage and
                              initiative. As eyewitnesses report, Japanese bullets and cannons always fired their
                              shot and landed it as well, while the Russian projectiles didn’t even hit their target
                              once. - The start of the 
                              Russo-Japanese war seems similar to the start of the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12583" target="_blank">Spanish-American war</a> some time ago. Back then, the first battle also happened on the ocean, the American
                              admiral <a href="person036" target="_blank"><em>Dewey</em></a> 
                              destroyed the entire Spanish marine in front of the <a href="place084" target="_blank">Philippines</a> in one night and steered the war into the direction of the American victory. The
                              Russo-Japanese war seems to go along these lines as well. Because of these first victories
                              
                              <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> managed to prevent the Russian marines from reaching <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> and marching into <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a> from there. The first battles on 
                              land will probably occur in <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> or at the border to <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a> and as it seems, <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> will win. They are better prepared and show 
                              more courage. The Russians on the other hand have lost some of their courage after
                              the first losses and lost courage don’t fare well on the battlefield. When the troops
                              fall, they will fall.

                              The whole world looks at the first victories of <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> with awe. It is known that the Japanese military training is highly advanced and
                              they have proven great strength. However, rumour has it that there are <em>English officers</em>
                              on the ships who are dressed like the Japanese as to not be recognised and they are
                              commanding the Japanese ships. If this is true, the admiration of the Japanese might
                              is unwarranted as the English marine is the best in the world.

                              More news followed the first Japanese victories.

                           <p>
                              The first message was fetched from a Russian gazette in <a href="place018" target="_blank">St Petersburg</a>, which reported on a telegram sent by admiral <a href="person041" target="_blank">Alekseyev</a> - the Russian govenor in <a href="place024" target="_blank">Asia</a> - to the <a href="person042" target="_blank">tsar</a>:
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              “I have to inform about Japanese torpedo ships (ships that are tasked with destroying
                              the enemy’s fleet) that were ambushing Russian war ships which were leaving the harbour
                              of <a href="place083" target="_blank">Port Arthur</a>. During this attack   <em>three ironclads have 
                                 been destroyed: “Retvizan”, “Tsesarevich”, and “Pallada”</em>.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              That is how the first message from the war side is written. One could imagine that
                              if the Russian admiral delivered this telegram, the Russian loss must have been more
                              severe as he has let on, as later sources described. The Japanese attacked worked
                              so well: the Russian battle ships shot back, but 
                              did not hit their targets and did not damage the Japanese. To caluclate the losses,
                              it is important to understand what it means when an armed battle ship gets destroyed.
                              Generally, an armed battle ship is to be understood as an <em>entire army corps</em>. A battle ship is worth 20 million. 
                              As <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> lost three battle ships during the first attack, it amounts to three corps and 60
                              million. Furthermore, the loss of a ship is even greater, as building a ship like
                              this takes years and years and the damage cannot be restored.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              All of <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> was shocked by the news of the first loss. The <a href="person042" target="_blank">tsar</a>’s ball has been cancelled because of it. The Russian stock plunged, the Russian enemies
                              had a party, their allies grieved alongside them - 
                              but soon a new message about the second Russian loss, which was even worse than the
                              first one, was received.
                              </p> 
                           
                           <p>
                              The governer <a href="person041" target="_blank">Alekseyev</a> sent the following telegram to the <a href="person042" target="_blank">tsar</a>:

                              “On Monday, the Japanese troops, consiting of 15 battle ships, started to bomb the
                              harbour of <a href="place083" target="_blank">Port Arthur</a>. We shot back from the fortress. After one hour, the Japanese stopped firing arms
                              and left the harbour. Two officers and 54 soldiers are wounded, 
                              10 soldiers have been killed. The Russian battle ships “Poltava”, “Diana”, “Askold”,
                              and “Novik” have been

                              This is how the governor delivered the news, and everyone can therefore be certain
                              that the Russian loss has been much worse. Again, four battleships were damaged, the
                              fortress suffered. The second defeat was even worse than the first one.
                              </p>

                              The third Japanese victory is also being reported on. At sea, next to the bay of <a href="place085" target="_blank">Chemulp'o</a>, Russian and Japanese battleships went into battle. <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> demolished the battleships, “Korietz” and “Varyag”. Most of the crew 
                              were able to save themselves, but in turn they were captured by <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a>. The Japanese battleships have only been slightly damaged. According to the latest
                              news, <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> managed to stop the Manchurian train and destroy it. 
                              This is another big win as the Russian military deliveries are interrupted.

                              Generally, the Russian defeats are confirmed to be greater and showed that there is
                              not one capable admiral on the Russian fronts. <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> is on the best path to be completely defeated at sea.

                           <p>
                              The war between <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> and <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> broke out mainly because of <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> and <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a>. Meaning, <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> 
                              and <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> are not at war because of their own countries, but because of foreign ones. <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> is a small country, amassing 218,650 square kilometres with 10 million inhabitants.
                              Those inhabitants are great fanatics, lazy, 
                              half-asleep and live like their ancestors a hundred years ago. The ruler of the country
                              calls himself an “emperor”, but is in reality a man without courage or power; foreign
                              ambassadors do whatever they want. He is controlled by the Russian ambassador as well
                              as the Japanese, the English and the American one, and even by 
                              women. A Russian cook and an English governess influence him greatly. He just lets
                              it all happen. Up until 10 years ago, China had the biggest authority in <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a>, formally it belonged to <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a>. Because of <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a>, 
                              the last Chinese-Japanese war, where <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> emerged as victor, broke out as well. Back then, <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> wanted to take all of Korea, but the allied powers of <a href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a>, 
                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>, and <a href="place045" target="_blank">France</a> interfered and forced <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> to acknowledge <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> as an independent state - not part of 
                              <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a>, not part of <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a>. However, <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> needs <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> because of trade, it needs to settle their merchants there. 
                              After the war, <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> started to invade <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> and to cause problems for <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> causing the Russian-Japanese relationship to be strained and irritated.

                              After the last uprising in <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a>, the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q150229" target="_blank">Boxer Rebellion</a>, where the “Boxers” rose up against foreigners, every country sent their military
                              there to suppress the rebellion. After the situation calmed down, everyone’s military
                              
                              retreated, except for <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>, which stayed in the Chinese province of <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a>. <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> occupied this region during the rebellion and refused to retreat. At first, it was

                              governments demanded <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> to vacate the area - after that <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> forced <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a> to enter in an agreement after which <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> 
                              is allowed to keep occupying the province <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuaria</a> as long as it wants to. <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a> should continue to be a Chinese province only by name. Because of the occupation
                              of <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a>, 
                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> became a closer neighbour to Korea, which bothered <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> quite a lot. But also other governments are not satisfied with this situation, mainly
                              <a href="place011" target="_blank">England</a> and 
                              <a href="place094" target="_blank">America</a>, which are interested in <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a> because of trade. Therefore, they put stones in <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>’s path and disrupted their trading. They wanted to close every Manchurian harbours
                              for 
                              foreign trade. Still, <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a> went into agreement with several other governments allowing them to trade however
                              much they want. <a href="place011" target="_blank">England</a> and <a href="place094" target="_blank">America</a> therefore drove 
                              <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> continuously to not let <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> fob them off. And <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a>, who could be sure that it had two big powers backing them up, demanded of <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> 
                              to relinquish any Korean influence and vacate <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a>. The negotiations dragged on for months. <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> agreed to give up influence on Korea, but not to leave <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a> - 
                              but <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> demanded both.

                              Lately, <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> started to prepare for war in <a href="place024" target="_blank">Asia</a>. <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> on the other side, also braced themselves for war. After a while, <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> 
                              realised that <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> took ages to answer <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a>’s demand and hesitated for weeks on end, therefore only playing for time in order
                              to finish preparing for war. Hence, <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> called back 
                              their ambassador from <a href="place018" target="_blank">St Petersburg</a>, meaning <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> is not ready anymore to negotiate with <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>, meaning <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> will protect their 
                              rights with a blade. On Sunday then, the <em>war</em> began.

                              <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> mostly consists of mountains. There are several high mountains and even volcanoes,
                              which means the mountain erupts fire. The climate there is healthy: in the summer
                              there is a warm and moist south wind, in the winter it is cold, harsh north wind.
                              The population grows continuously. 
                              Each year it grows by 1/9. Every year, there are 350,000 marriages and 100,000 divorces.
                              Each year over one million children are being born while 800,000 people die. <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> has a lot of big cities, for example the capital, <em><a href="place086" target="_blank">Tokyo</a></em> with 1,350,000 
                              inhabitants, <a href="place087" target="_blank">Osaka</a> - 500,000, <a href="place088" target="_blank">Kyoto</a> - 340,000, <a href="place089" target="_blank">Nogoya</a> - 250,000, <a href="place090" target="_blank">Taiwan</a> - 240,000, <a href="place091" target="_blank">Kōbe</a>

                              speak the same language, wear the same clothes, practise the same customs and religion.
                              Concerning their looks, they are similar to Mongols. The men’s average height is 158
                              cm and women’s 
                              145 cm, their skin tone is of a light yellow, their hair is black as well as thick
                              and strong, but their facial hair thin and weak. Some time ago they used to wear plaits
                              like the Chinese, but since they got more civilised they cut them off. The Japanese
                              are known  are known for their cleanliness, they are kind, decent, and polite. 
                              Their children respect and honour their parents. There are several schools and a university
                              in <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a>, where Hebrew is taught as well. Over 800 newspapers and bulletins are published
                              there. The press law is very strict. The Japanese people lead a moderate lifestyle,
                              they mostly eat rice, 
                              millet, fish and similar, but not a lot of meat. Their clothes are made of linen,
                              their houses are lowly built and made out of wood, and the roofs are made out of shingles
                              or covered with straw - very rarely bricks are used. As the houses are built very
                              closely next to each other, fires can spread quickly. - Most Japanese live off of
                              
                              farming, livestock breeding, and mining. As of recently, factories were being built
                              which export their merchandise abroad. The arts are rather developed, Japanese paper,
                              porcelain, and paintings are known all over the globe.

                              demand a lot of money to free the captives.

                           <p>
                              This story we are telling here is historically true and happened in the old city of
                              <a href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a> in <a href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a>. In the thirteenth century - according to the Gregorian calendar - 
                              the principality of <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130875" target="_blank">Hohenstauffen</a> ruled in this city. The city was surrounded with high walls and moats and the royal
                              palace is situated on a beautiful hill.  At this time the principality ruled over
                              
                              the whole land because one prince was the brother in law of the <a href="person043" target="_blank">Roman emperor</a> - the ruler of <a href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a> at that time. The German peoples were dissatisfied with their sovereign and were
                              said to have 
                              planned a rebellion. In <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="date">1285</span>, the <a href="person044" target="_blank">Count of Württemberg</a> started a rebellion in order to dispose of Emperor <a href="person045" target="_blank">Rudolf</a>, 
                              but <a href="person045" target="_blank">Rudolf</a> forcefully suppressed the rebellion with his military.
                              </p> 
                           
                           <p>
                              The Jewish people in <a href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a> were valued at that time and have been protected by the prince against the masses,
                              which used to attack the Jewish people a lot. The clergyman incited 
                              violence against the Jewish people. The principality was short on money and borrowed
                              funds from the rich Jewish people leading to the principality protecting the Jewish
                              people and letting no harm happen to them. The principality therefore issued rights
                              and privileges, forbidding anyone to do harm as they were the prince’s subjects.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              At that time, there was a Rabbi in <a href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a>, <a href="person046" target="_blank">Rabbi <em>Meir</em></a> of <a href="" target="_blank"><a href="place047" target="_blank">Worms</a></a> - may his memory be a blessing. An important gaon, who spread 
                              the light of the Torah across the whole country. He was also a knowledgeable scholar
                              in various sciences and asked every important question for advice. He led his community
                              with knowledge and in godliness. He was well-known in all of <a href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a>, from all sides he was asked 
                              questions to receive the answers and what he said was accepted. He was so popular
                              that he was just called “<a href="person046" target="_blank">Meir of Rothenburg</a>”. He also led a yeshiva where students from all around came to study under him.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              As the prince of <a href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a> heard how popular the Rabbi of his city was, he was delighted how prominent his city
                              had become. He held the Rabbi in high regard and consulted 
                              with him on various political questions as well as admired the intelligence and reasoning
                              of the <a href="person046" target="_blank">Meir</a> of <a href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a>.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Only as the rebellion against Emperor <a href="person045" target="_blank">Rudolf</a> broke out did the situation of the Jewish community deteriorate. The rebellion disturbed
                              the order in the country, everyone did whatever they wanted, ignored the law, and
                              stole one another’s money - and 
                              everybody put the blame on the Jewish people to consume the funds. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              During this time, the Meir of <a href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a> ran circles around his wide, but low chambers, deep in thought. The rabbi has always
                              - as he was an old man already - looked well, went upright, was neither bent nor broken.
                              Therefore, everyone admired him, but 
                              immediately saw that he looked anxious and sick. He was dressed in his silken long
                              coat, with a silken belt - both dropped down to his feet - on his head was a sable-hat,
                              and in his hand he held a sceptre with a silver top. It was noticeable that he wanted
                              to go somewhere. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              A young student stood next to the table with great respect, but he could not hold
                              himself back as he saw his frightened Rabbi and asked with quiet voice:
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              “What worries you? I ask of you, my dear Rabbi, tell me why you are so scared and
                              unhappy? I am not used to seeing you distressed like this. Forgive me, dearest Rabbi,
                              that I dare to question you today. 
                              But I am aware that you told me all your secrets as your student, so why do you remain
                              silent today? It is not the first time you have been called to the prince, who holds
                              you in high respect and always 
                              welcomes you with mercy and grace. Why then are you so distressed?!
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              “You are right, my dearest!” answered <a href="person046" target="_blank">Meir</a>. Those who are confident do not need to be sad. However, I have been plagued by several
                              fears. I think the good times for us Jews in 
                              <a href="place099" target="_blank">Rothenburg</a> are over and tough, sad days are to come. Our sun is setting and the darkest night
                              is starting.”
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The student was perplexed.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Did you perhaps forget the horrible plague which is going around in the <a href="place101" target="_blank">Rhinelands</a>, in <a href="place" target="_blank"><a href="place102" target="_blank">Bavaria</a></a> 
                              and in the bordering countries?” The <a href="person046" target="_blank">Meir</a> asked him. “Did you forget the hardship under which our brothers suffered? Not only
                              three years have gone by since the mob attacked 
                              our brothers in <a href="place046" target="_blank">Mainz</a> and burnt them. In <a href="place104" target="_blank">Munich</a>, as well, a Jewish quarter was locked up and set on fire from all four sides 
                              and all Jewish people have been thrown into the fire afterwards - A messenger from
                              the city of <a href="place105" target="_blank">Oberwesel</a> arrived yesterday and bore a horrible announcement: the clergymen there 
                              defamed the Jewish people there having slaughtered a Christian child in order to sacrifice
                              its blood for an offering. The clergymen set the people against the Jewish people
                              with this false accusation which are scared of being 
                              outside now. If this slander is now believed by the mobs, then heaven help us, massive
                              hardship will come over Jewish people. Now, a rebellion broke out in the country,
                              the revolutionists are not far from our lands. Wherever 
                              they go, they will unleash all of their wrath upon the Jewish people… This grim situation saddens me and I am very afraid why the
                              prince called for me today”.

                              “Why my dearest Rabbi, are you afraid and forgot that God - praise the Lord - the
                              guardian of <a href="place050" target="_blank">Jerusalem</a> does not sleep?” - the student asked. “You are constantly aware that 
                              God is our guard, up to today, he protects us and will also not leave us now!”
                              </p>

                              “Of course, I know this, my child” - <a href="person046" target="_blank">Meir</a> answered “but I am telling you that it scares me. One of my acquaintances of the
                              Christian court told me that some days ago a man arrived who I am fearful 
                              of. As people have told me, the scoundrel <a href="person054" target="_blank">Kneppe</a>, who has been chasing me like a snake, arrived.”
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              All colour vanished from the face of the student as he heard the name of <a href="person054" target="_blank">Kneppe</a>.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              And the Rabbi continued: “For some years already, this evildoer has been following
                              us wherever we go. Every false accusation, every defamation, every evil law, every
                              persecution stems from him. His 
                              roots go back to us, but he is our greatest enemy. In his youth, he has studied under
                              me, I raised him; but now he has turned his back and has become evil. He knows the
                              Jewish ways and                
                              is aware how to pursue. Additionally, he was very furious as I was not giving him
                              my only daughter for a wife. Three years ago he left my house and his faith and became
                              the leader of the enemies 
                              of Israel. Therefore, he certainly arrived at the royal court to destroy me and the
                              whole community with it. That is what I am scared of. I will soon go to the prince
                              and see whether my fear is justified.”
