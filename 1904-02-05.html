                              Our Newspaper is made for the Jewish people as a whole, for everything who finds interest
                              in important articles about all matters concerning our brothers
                              in the whole world; in every issue we want to give detailed reports about all polictical
                              occurances and want to deliver all important news as well as those that belong
                              to all Jewish matter, as well as general world news. Therefore, every Jew will find
                              in our paper a short but detailed list about everything important and intereseting
                              and
                              does not have to make great effort to read Polish or German newspapers, which the
                              general public does not completely understand.

                              the true Jewry, which are the religion and our Jewish teaching  and also see to teach
                              their children the truth. Our pious, honest brothers have not had a single Jewish
                              paper until today,
                              what should be written according to his opinion, his view and his thoughts, about
                              all the matters, that are concerning Jewish people as a whole, writing and reporting
                              in a way, which does not harm our ultra-orthodox brothers. This paper is written in
                              ordinary Jewish language, which everyone should understand, which hasn’t existed yet
                              and this should be our newspaper.

                              We don’t want to promise our honored readers too much. We want to make an effort to
                              follow the article of our sages: “Say little and do much!” We want to think, that
                              our paper should always be 
                              important and interesting and we hope that our Jewish brothers, in general our orthodox
                              brothers want to support us if possible in order that we can pay what we are planning

                              Dear Editor!
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Your announcement that you are publishing a Jewish paper in ordinary Jewish native
                              language, a newspaper which you are promising us in your program that it will only
                              be written in a Yiddish format, 
                              unlike every other newspaper sincerely simply delighted me - I have touched upon this
                              matter several times and emphasized it at every possibility, that a Jewish paper in
                              simple language is missing 
                              for our Jewish people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span> - some would claim that such a paper could not exist in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span> and that it cannot survive in any way, proof being that every 
                              Jewish jargon newspaper in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span> had to give up very shortly after publishing the first time, they could not create
                              an existence for themselves. But the reason for that is, 
                              the big difference between those papers and yours is that they were edited and written
                              by another class of writers, and “The Geniune Jew” on the other hand will be in another
                              manner, those papers were 
                              party journals, for example, Zionist, socialist, etc.  This on the other hand according
                              to the program will be paper for the common Jew, it will publish articles from good
                              writers, but in Jewish 
                              manner, good stories, anecdotes from sages and heroes and historical events, which
                              will interest our Jewish audience. Summarised, the need for this type of newspaper is currently very acute.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              But still, I know very well, that that paper is missing, I know very well that you
                              have a lot of enemies, one will also deter from disturbing your undertaking, because
                              the paper will not be a 
                              big advantage to your enemies. Anyways, the public will not be interested for Jewish
                              matters, and everything that is Jewish is foreign. But you must be indifferent to
                              all those obstacles, and 
                              you should also not be bothered in your undertaking, you have to work bravely and
                              enthusiastically for the benefit of the Jewish public.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Baseless hatred cannot harm you, I also want to remind, in a pact that this will also
                              encourage you for your undertaking not to fear and to come to the conviction: “Either
                              you don’t need it or 
                              it doesn’t help it”, as everyone says, “All beginnings are difficult” - how many stones
                              have been laid in the way of your newspaper “The Voice of the religious”, but everything
                              has been overcome. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              It might also be that I alone have made a mistake, and you cannot say with certainty
                              that your paper will not have enemies, perhaps it is wrong, there will be many good
                              friends, who want to support 
                              your work and furthermore give “gratitude”, the public will finally be convinced that
                              this paper is the right organ that is needed in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span>. - </p>

                           <p>either way, you have to think 
                              about creating a good paper, and not about upcoming opinion of everyone, you have
                              to turn your hope to the Jewish public, who hopefully will understand the value of
                              the “Geniune Jew”.

                              “You can recognise them by their temple”. If we want to know, which damage the assimilation,
                              the mingling with the other customs - has done to the Jewish peoples, we only need
                              to look at the fruits 
                              of the assimilation. Slowly, cautiously, step by step, the assimilation, what our
                              “educated” Jewish people have called “progressive” and “culture”, has led the Jewry
                              down a mountain. First, they have changed 
                              the Jewish garment, afterwards the Jewish names, afterwards the Jewish language and
                              at the end the entire religion…  when our blessed rabbis have written and fought against
                              the assimilation, against 
                              the wrong <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q472670" target="_blank">“Haskalah”</a>, which blinds the eyes and confuses the thoughts, which has deceived the people,
                              which will deliver the end of the whole movement to heresy in the religion 
                              of God - they had been viewed as fanatics, they had been laughed at and mocked. Now,
                              also the so-called Haskalahs have to admit that our ultra-orthodox brothers were right:
                              the religious heresy has 
                              indeed been a “small matter” now, it belongs to every day actions, that someone who
                              is a religious heretic is too nice to a  job, an employment, too nice to a business,
                              a wife or simply too nice to 
                              “society”, too nice to his children - like he says - so that they don’t have to suffer
                              for their Jewry like him. A “convert” as once been something very rare, it has both
                              been for Jewish people and for non-Jewish people 
                              alike an “event”, people talked and wrote about it - today this has all stopped: nowadays
                              there are already so many baptised each year, that is has been necessary to publish
                              a set of statistics each time.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              And thus, a statistic about the baptised Jewish people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place007" target="_blank">Vienna</a></span> has been published now, from which we can see, that in one of the last years 551
                              Jewish people have been baptised in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place007" target="_blank">Vienna</a></span>, 
                              namely 313 men and 238 women. In this statistic, the job and occupation of the baptised
                              Jewish people has exactly been noted down and we found, for example, 72 girls under
                              30, of which most have surely been baptised on the 
                              occasion of “love” to a Christian, which is the consequence of a non-Jewish upbringing
                              of our daughters. We also find 84 baptisms of people, who work so-called freelance
                              jobs, for example attorneys, 
                              doctors, public officers, and such, also 51 students, so exactly those people, who
                              have come across with Haskalah and progress and have hidden until the atheism. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              And this public statistic has not made a huge impression at all. “When a person commits
                              a crime again, he shall be punished!” People have gotten used to it, not only the
                              baptised are not ashamed 
                              with their actions, but also their families don’t see it as a disgrace to have a “Christian
                              convert” in the family, it has already stopped being a stain in the family. “Have
                              you heard, Mr. N. N. 
                              has been baptised”, are Jewish people asking each other, completely indifferent, nobody
                              gets worked up about it, nobody is surprised, but people think that what is going
                              on is a daily occurrence. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              And who is at fault for this? We have to admit: the common Jew, the pious are also
                              not completely free of every reproach. It has been tolerated in great Jewish communities,
                              that a leader 
                              (of the Jewish community) has been baptised and he stayed the leader, the Jewish society
                              is still associating with the baptised, as if they still remained to be Jewish, people
                              are still 
                              getting married with them, they are still trading and walking together, people let
                              them  represent them, people give them their children to teach them and such - because
                              of they have lost 
                              their shame because of that others have lost their shame as well, to imitate them
                              or plan to do so.

                              But not that alone is the sole cause that the baptisms are rising more and more. there
                              are deeper reasons present, that lead to baptisms. The poor upbringing of the youth,
                              the religious 
                              education in schools, which is only <em>education</em> and not <em>religion</em>, that means, the children study and study and nevertheless know nothing, the bad
                              behaviour of the parents, 
                              the carelessness of the community, the lack of scholars who preach with passion, who
                              should work against the lack and indifference for religion with courage and energy.
                              All of that 
                              led to this atheism and in will not get better until our whole life will improve again,
                              not for the worse like the reform-Jewish people caused, but for the better: <em>To return the crown back to the 
                                 Torah!</em>

                              of money. A big part of those emigrants consists of Jewish people, who don’t have

                              gatherings are being convened and committees are being elected, 
                              who pay attention to the question how to improve the financial situation. A <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2908887" target="_blank">Bat Kol</a> has been shared: “let’s support the domestic products” - whoever establishes a new
                              business, who wants to build a 
                              new factory, get subsidies and support, in order to be able to survive against the

                              Only for us Galician Jewish people everything is still calm and quiet, like it is
                              not missing for us. Here, you don’t hear anything about that, nobody is thinking about
                              new sources of income, to get our poor 
                              brothers’ livelihood. While everywhere in the whole world the merchant, the industrialist,
                              even the skilled craftsman and tradesman are respected and valued like public officials

                           <p>lawyers, us 
                              Galician Jewish people, who are reproached being a nation of traders, even the merchant,
                              the entrepreneur in a small business, everyone wants to make “doctors”, “public officials”
                              out of our children, but 
                              there are already so many and nowadays it is very hard for a Jew to become a public
                              official, even a small one with a low salary. Besides, the Jewry also suffers because
                              of that, because a merchant 
                              can continue being a Jew, like a “doctor” or a “public official”. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The situation of the Galician Jewish people is even worse than the situation of other
                              Galician peoples, for they are cared for by the state committee, different institutions,
                              and associations like the 
                              “Kulka Ralnitsche” and others. Many associations and committees care for them. We
                              Jewish people are dependent on ourselves; nobody cares for us, and nobody worries
                              about us. We do not 
                              know if the effort of the various societies and committees will result in a working
                              industry and factories in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span>, which will have a practical success or not. But one 
                              thing we do know, there will be absolutely no benefit for us Jewish people resulting
                              from that. 
                              </p>

                              “If we don’t get that, what do we have?” If we don’t want to take care of ourselves,
                              no one will. “Go and make a living for yourself!” said <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person011" target="_blank">King David</a></span> already. Therefore, it’s 
                              time that Jewish committees should be made already, who should investigate creating
                              new enterprises, who should give our poor brothers a livelihood. Here in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span>, there are 
                              enough Jewish people who have assets and can found companies, from which hundreds
                              of families can survive and don’t have to wander around abroad and be roaming around.
                              Already, there is no luck left to be 
                              found in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place008" target="_blank">America</a></span>, in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place61" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span>, in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a></span>, in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place011" target="_blank">England</a></span>, the Polish and the Galician Jewish people are not welcome anymore, 
                              they are not met with friendly faces and everyone wants to get rid of them. With a
                              little bit of entrepreneurial spirit people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span> can create livelihood for oneself and 
                              others. The time and populace are ripe, and we have to make use of it. We have to
                              fulfil our duties of being a citizen of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place012" target="_blank">Babylon</a></span> and especially as Jewish people.

                           <p>
                              A preacher once said as a joke that the appeal of the Pharao, King of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place013" target="_blank">Egypt</a></span> was, that the Jewish boys were tossed into water and 
                              the girls should continue living, because the Pharao wanted to eliminate the Jewish
                              people and he knew that as long as the Jewish people stay Jewish and hold on 
                              to their Jewry, nothing can harm them, that’s why he said to drown newborns, but only
                              the boys because the girls know little of being Jewish and can 
                              therefore grow accustomed to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place013" target="_blank">Egypt</a></span> and learn its customs - therefore they have not disturbed his plan to eliminate the
                              Jewish people. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Still, there is a little bit of truth in this joke, if we look at the manner, how
                              it was for us Jewish people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span>, now for the pious people, 
                              who raise daughters. But there is also a lot to complain about the education of our
                              boys. We can see that the children raised in a Jewish manner are becoming less 
                              and less. Also pious, honest parents sometimes don’t care too much about educating
                              their children Jewish so it would plant the Jewish spirit and feel it in the young
                              
                              hearts, and to awaken and maintain the love for their people, according to the Torah
                              and our holy faith. But just the manner of our daughter’s education is already 
                              quite bad, that it’s above all measures - and we find that in Jewish newspapers, which
                              are not necessarily pious ones, complain often about this negligence - and 
                              that’s justified.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              We often see that the fathers now let their children go to school which stops his
                              teaching and leads to away from passionate education which educates
                              them well and pious - the same father does not care about his daughters and as a formality
                              offered an explanation: “Everyone who teaches their daughters the Torah, teaches 
                              nonsense”. He forgets that that our late scholars have conveyed it very differently
                              as he understands it. He lets his children go to school, they are learning "<em>religion</em>" 
                              from a teacher who himself is not pious and he can interpret the sacred texts, but
                              he cannot uphold them… all of that he removes because going to school is the legal
                              
                              obligation of everyone. But after they have finished already finished school, there
                              is a completely new education, which the government does not force onto anybody and
                              
                              what not only not harm the Jewry, but also the wealth, because <em>luxury</em> will grow because of it… our daughters will then have to read bad and corrupt books
                              which not even 
                              children of other people.  They go and listen to talks and lectures about matters,
                              they are not at all interested in, they only go there to get into the society life.
                              
                              They are quitting talking the Jewish language, chatter different sentences from various
                              “modern” authors, although they don’t understand what those authors write and say
                              - 
                              and as they get older and start talking about engagement, only then the parents, who
                              want to have a Jewish, pious son-in-law, see how bad they have become. The Jewish
                              
                              daughter, who only talks Polish and associates only with young people, who dress in
                              modern clothes with shaved bears, a long moustache and shining boots, looks at the
                              
                              young Jewish man, like any type of company, she doesn’t want to hear or know about
                              a Jewish engagement, and demands an “educated” young man, if not even a “German, son
                              
                              of a German” … If the father is strong enough to force the daughter to take the son-in-law
                              that he wants to have, he helps along to do something he has neglected until 
                              now. But sometimes, it is already too late. Or the daughter is “strong” enough, which
                              means she doesn’t have to listen to her father, she threatens to throw herself into

                              then the parent’s life is embittered, they are not getting a son-in-law like they
                              want, later they will have a grandchild, they have to be ashamed of - and the beautiful

                              These are the consequences of bad upbringing of our daughters. Besides that, the incredible
                              luxury, which is a consequence of this upbringing, eats up the Jewish fortune 
                              and brings some heads of the family, who could live in peace, poverty, and hardship.
                              Because the Jewish daughters who have gotten such an education has estranged with
                              her 
                              parents, she doesn’t feel for them, she doesn’t understand them, she doesn’t want
                              to know if the parents know or not - she needs to imitate all “fashion” and the parents
                              
                              need to give in, because the daughter is already a real “woman”, she talks Polish
                              and the parents need to respect her!...

                              of a sudden now hear that the government has called together all other provinces to
                              an assembly, in which it is to be consulted if Jewish people should be allowed to
                              live 
                              in the whole country of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span>, unlike now as they are crowded together in few provinces like chickens on the roost
                              and only the best, for example those who are

Rumour has it, that several provinces are in favour of expanding the Jew’s rights
                              to live 
                              in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> as they cannot watch anymore at the misery and poverty, in which those Jewish people
                              have to live in, and which are caused by living cramped like this and having 
                              to rip bits out of each other’s mouths. The governor of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place017" target="_blank">Bessarabia</a></span>, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person002" target="_blank">Prince <em>Urusov</em></a></span>, 
                              was particularly fond of caring for Jewish people said: “The whole Jewish question
                              is <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> is only a consequence of the bad economical state in which Jewish people have to
                              live 
                              because of living so closely squeezed together that they should be allowed to expand
                              their right of abode, so they would fare better and also to weaken the hatred towards
                              them.”</p>
                           
                           <p>
                              It must be really bad and bitter for Jewish people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> that now Antisemites like those provinces now have pity towards them. That is the
                              truth! The situation of the 
                              Russian Jewish people is indeed very unfortunate, and it gets worse each day. However,
                              we do not really believe that the government sincerely wants to actually help them.
                              All of that consulting 
                              done for the provinces is a joke in of itself, which has the purpose to palm off the
                              world. The Russian government has now realised that, even as a big country as <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> 
                              cannot defy the whole world, the persecution of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place015" target="_blank">Chișinău</a></span> and these cruelties outraged the whole world, there were protests in the whole world. The American government 
                              even wanted to submit a written protest via their ambassador in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place018" target="_blank">Petersburg</a></span>. But the Russian government didn’t want to do anything with all of that, it didn’t
                              want to 
                              accept the protests and let the joke of the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place015" target="_blank">Chișinău</a></span> litigation happen, apparently to show the world: I herd you like cats! -

                              However now, as <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> is in conflict with <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> and war could break out any day, the Russian government sees, that they cannot resist
                              the 
                              whole world, no matter how strong they are. The whole world supports <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span>, every government wishes for <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a></span> to be victorious,

                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span>’s allies, <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place045" target="_blank">France</a></span>, also stands on this side; <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> must be afraid to lose 
                              in this war and then all the honour will be gone. Only now it has to realise that
                              it wasn’t the best idea to not ask anybody - and therefore fool the world. To now
                              proof that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> 
                              is not as bad as it’s known, the meeting of the provinces has been called in to let
                              the newspapers know that they want to treat the Jewish people better now.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              But will that work? Will the world let itself be tricked again as it has been once
                              already? - It doesn’t seem like it. - a liar as the world says correctly, nobody believes
                              it. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a></span> has to <em>proof</em>, that it wants 
                              to treat the Jewish people better now, it doesn’t have to call in meetings and ask
                              for advice. It needs to act, it has to abolish the exception laws against Jewish people
                              and treat them humanly - only then there is a possibility 
                              of friendship with the world again, which it has lost caused by its harmful performance
                              and what it is missing severely now.

                              the Czechs do not want to knock off any of their demands. They are dertermined to

Lately, all negociations 
                              that had been held let to no results, even what the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person003" target="_blank">Emporer</a></span> has said only to the vice president of the council,

                              success. The 
                              Czechs do not want to succumb. - The government cannot give way to the Czech though,
                              because the Germans wanted to block and it would have been their own. - In the meantime,
                              the Czechs lost the 
                              little trust they had in the government; they say that the current minister president

                              capable of making peace and they demand that he should step down and another one should
                              step up. However, the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person003" target="_blank">Emperor</a></span> does not want to send him home until 
                              they are sure that neither the Czechs nor the Germans want to give way to the new
                              minister president. But this is not for sure and it doesn’t make sense if there should
                              be another minister.

                              In the meantime the imperial council has shut down and only the delegations are counceling.
                              The delegation is only to concern itself with <em> foreign</em> politics and with 
                              military matters. But because a great deal of members of the imperial council and
                              the manor house who are from different parties are part of the delegation and therefore
                              they mainly talk about  
                              <em>internal</em> matters, about the dispute between the Czech and German, etc., and very little about
                              foreign politics. Of course,  nothing comes of this all this talking, 
                              idle words remain, without a purpose or practical value. - Concurrently, the government
                              reigns with , 
                              it is working as well as possible, it even wants to negotiate new trade contracts
                              with German, and also the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209601" target="_blank">Compromise with Hungary</a> 
                              by the means of § 14, and because the Czechs treathen not to approve the recruit law
                              this year, the government also wants to pass this law with § 14.

There, the government’s situation is a lot more difficult. The
                              new minister president, 
                              <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person005" target="_blank">Count <em>Tisza</em></a></span> may have approved almost everything what the opposition wanted, solely the command
                              langauge in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place009" target="_blank">Hungary</a></span> 
                              being Hungarian, he did not grant. The greater part of the opposition also found peace
                              with this decision as well, merely some of the deportees don’t want to end this 
                              discussion and don’t want to give in the obstruction until the Hungarian command langauge
                              is being introduced as well, and the minister president cannot give this to them.
                              - That is why he decided to break the obstruction with force, he has announced in
                              parliament that if the opposition will not sign off the recruit law by , 
                              he will shut down the the imperial council and he will convene the delegation in order
                              for them to carry out the work, subsequently taking over the opposition by default.
                              
                              He will hold extensive sessions, he will introduce a new rules of procedure, and will
                              disolve the parliament as well as hold new elections if necessary. - The opposition
                              
                              still don’t want to give in, they declare not to be afraid to his threats. Several
                              members of the opposition have received threating letters claiming they will be shot
                              
                              if they don’t terminate with their obstruction, because those retired soldiers will
                              have to stay in the military and the reservists will be called upon. 
                              Nevertheless, they will not succumb. Who will win, the government or the opposition,
                              is not yet certain.

In the Austrian Delegation the antisemite <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Schneider</span> seized the opportunity to grumble about Jewish people. He said that Jewish 
                              merchants would sell poor merchandise abroad and therefore the reputation of Austrian
                              merchandise is sullied leading to no buyers. He also showed torn-up boots, which a
                              Jewish merchant wanted to export abroad. The delegation

We only want to talk about one miracle. During

                              <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51649" target="_blank">crusade</a>, which means they travelled to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place034" target="_blank">Israel</a></span> in order to take away the Holy Land from the Turks. Jewish people have suffered

                              asked <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person015" target="_blank">Rashi</a></span> before departure if he would be prosperous. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person015" target="_blank">Rashi</a></span> told him he will win the war and become king of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place050" target="_blank">Jerusalem</a></span>. 
                              But after that the Turks will come back to drive him away and he will return home
                              with three horses only. In the end, it happened like that, the only difference being
                              that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Godfrey</span> came back with four horses. He wanted to punish
