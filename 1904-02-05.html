                        Your announcement that you are publishing a Jewish paper in ordinary Jewish native
                        language, a newspaper which you are promising us in your program that it will only
                        be written in a Yiddish format, 
                        unlike every other newspaper sincerely simply delighted me - I have touched upon this
                        matter several times and emphasized it at every possibility, that a Jewish paper in
                        simple language is missing 
                        for our Jewish people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Galicia</span> - some would claim that such a paper could not exist in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Galicia</span> and that it cannot survive in any way, proof being that every 
                        Jewish jargon newspaper in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Galicia</span> had to give up very shortly after publishing the first time, they could not create
                        an existence for themselves. But the reason for that is, 
                        the big difference between those papers and yours is that they were edited and written
                        by another class of writers, and “The Geniune Jew” on the other hand will be in another
                        manner, those papers were 
                        party journals, for example, Zionist, socialist, etc.  This on the other hand according
                        to the program will be paper for the common Jew, it will publish articles from good
                        writers, but in Jewish 
                        manner, good stories, anecdotes from sages and heroes and historical events, which
                        will interest our Jewish audience. Summarised, the need for this type of newspaper is currently very acute.

                        have a lot of enemies, one will also deter from disturbing your undertaking, because
                        the paper will not be a 
                        big advantage to your enemies. Anyways, the public will not be interested for Jewish
                        matters, and everything that is Jewish is foreign. But you must be indifferent to
                        all those obstacles, and 
                        you should also not be bothered in your undertaking, you have to work bravely and

                        you don’t need it or 
                        it doesn’t help it”, as everyone says, “All beginnings are difficult” - how many stones
                        have been laid in the way of your newspaper “The Voice of the religious”, but everything

                        It might also be that I alone have made a mistake, and you cannot say with certainty
                        that your paper will not have enemies, perhaps it is wrong, there will be many good
                        friends, who want to support 
                        your work and furthermore give “gratitude”, the public will finally be convinced that

                        “You can recognise them by their temple”. If we want to know, which damage the assimilation,
                        the mingling with the other customs - has done to the Jewish peoples, we only need
                        to look at the fruits 
                        of the assimilation. Slowly, cautiously, step by step, the assimilation, what our
                        “educated” Jewish people have called “progressive” and “culture”, has led the Jewry
                        down a mountain. First, they have changed 
                        the Jewish garment, afterwards the Jewish names, afterwards the Jewish language and
                        at the end the entire religion…  when our blessed rabbis have written and fought against
                        the assimilation, against 
                        the wrong <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q472670" target="_blank">“Haskalah”</a>, which blinds the eyes and confuses the thoughts, which has deceived the people,
                        which will deliver the end of the whole movement to heresy in the religion 
                        of God - they had been viewed as fanatics, they had been laughed at and mocked. Now,
                        also the so-called Haskalahs have to admit that our ultra-orthodox brothers were right:
                        the religious heresy has 
                        indeed been a “small matter” now, it belongs to every day actions, that someone who
                        is a religious heretic is too nice to a  job, an employment, too nice to a business,
                        a wife or simply too nice to 
                        “society”, too nice to his children - like he says - so that they don’t have to suffer
                        for their Jewry like him. A “convert” as once been something very rare, it has both
                        been for Jewish people and for non-Jewish people 
                        alike an “event”, people talked and wrote about it - today this has all stopped: nowadays
                        there are already so many baptised each year, that is has been necessary to publish
                        a set of statistics each time.
                        </p>
                     
                     <p id="p__5" class="yes-index">
                        And thus, a statistic about the baptised Jewish people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Vienna</span> has been published now, from which we can see, that in one of the last years 551
                        Jewish people have been baptised in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Vienna</span>, 
                        namely 313 men and 238 women. In this statistic, the job and occupation of the baptised
                        Jewish people has exactly been noted down and we found, for example, 72 girls under
                        30, of which most have surely been baptised on the 
                        occasion of “love” to a Christian, which is the consequence of a non-Jewish upbringing
                        of our daughters. We also find 84 baptisms of people, who work so-called freelance
                        jobs, for example attorneys, 
                        doctors, public officers, and such, also 51 students, so exactly those people, who
                        have come across with Haskalah and progress and have hidden until the atheism.

                        And this public statistic has not made a huge impression at all. “When a person commits
                        a crime again, he shall be punished!” People have gotten used to it, not only the
                        baptised are not ashamed 
                        with their actions, but also their families don’t see it as a disgrace to have a “Christian
                        convert” in the family, it has already stopped being a stain in the family. “Have
                        you heard, Mr. N. N. 
                        has been baptised”, are Jewish people asking each other, completely indifferent, nobody
                        gets worked up about it, nobody is surprised, but people think that what is going
                        on is a daily occurrence.

                        And who is at fault for this? We have to admit: the common Jew, the pious are also
                        not completely free of every reproach. It has been tolerated in great Jewish communities,
                        that a leader 
                        (of the Jewish community) has been baptised and he stayed the leader, the Jewish society
                        is still associating with the baptised, as if they still remained to be Jewish, people
                        are still 
                        getting married with them, they are still trading and walking together, people let
                        them  represent them, people give them their children to teach them and such - because
                        of they have lost 
                        their shame because of that others have lost their shame as well, to imitate them
                        or plan to do so.

                        But not that alone is the sole cause that the baptisms are rising more and more. there
                        are deeper reasons present, that lead to baptisms. The poor upbringing of the youth,
                        the religious 
                        education in schools, which is only <em>education</em> and not <em>religion</em>, that means, the children study and study and nevertheless know nothing, the bad
                        behaviour of the parents, 
                        the carelessness of the community, the lack of scholars who preach with passion, who
                        should work against the lack and indifference for religion with courage and energy.
                        All of that 
                        led to this atheism and in will not get better until our whole life will improve again,
                        not for the worse like the reform-Jewish people caused, but for the better: <em>To return the crown back to the

                        out of our children, but 
                        there are already so many and nowadays it is very hard for a Jew to become a public
                        official, even a small one with a low salary. Besides, the Jewry also suffers because
                        of that, because a merchant 
                        can continue being a Jew, like a “doctor” or a “public official”.

                        The situation of the Galician Jewish people is even worse than the situation of other
                        Galician peoples, for they are cared for by the state committee, different institutions,
                        and associations like the

                        Jewish people are dependent on ourselves; nobody cares for us, and nobody worries
                        about us. We do not

                        enough Jewish people who have assets and can found companies, from which hundreds

                        A preacher once said as a joke that the appeal of the Pharao, King of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Egypt</span> was, that the Jewish boys were tossed into water and 
                        the girls should continue living, because the Pharao wanted to eliminate the Jewish
                        people and he knew that as long as the Jewish people stay Jewish and hold on 
                        to their Jewry, nothing can harm them, that’s why he said to drown newborns, but only
                        the boys because the girls know little of being Jewish and can 
                        therefore grow accustomed to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Egypt</span> and learn its customs - therefore they have not disturbed his plan to eliminate the

                        Still, there is a little bit of truth in this joke, if we look at the manner, how
                        it was for us Jewish people in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Galicia</span>, now for the pious people, 
                        who raise daughters. But there is also a lot to complain about the education of our
                        boys. We can see that the children raised in a Jewish manner are becoming less 
                        and less. Also pious, honest parents sometimes don’t care too much about educating
                        their children Jewish so it would plant the Jewish spirit and feel it in the young
                        
                        hearts, and to awaken and maintain the love for their people, according to the Torah
                        and our holy faith. But just the manner of our daughter’s education is already 
                        quite bad, that it’s above all measures - and we find that in Jewish newspapers, which
                        are not necessarily pious ones, complain often about this negligence - and 
                        that’s justified.

                        We often see that the fathers now let their children go to school which stops his
                        teaching and leads to away from passionate education which educates
                        them well and pious - the same father does not care about his daughters and as a formality
                        offered an explanation: “Everyone who teaches their daughters the Torah, teaches 
                        nonsense”. He forgets that that our late scholars have conveyed it very differently
                        as he understands it. He lets his children go to school, they are learning "<em>religion</em>" 
                        from a teacher who himself is not pious and he can interpret the sacred texts, but
                        he cannot uphold them… all of that he removes because going to school is the legal
                        
                        obligation of everyone. But after they have finished already finished school, there
                        is a completely new education, which the government does not force onto anybody and
                        
                        what not only not harm the Jewry, but also the wealth, because <em>luxury</em> will grow because of it… our daughters will then have to read bad and corrupt books
                        which not even 
                        children of other people.  They go and listen to talks and lectures about matters,
                        they are not at all interested in, they only go there to get into the society life.
                        
                        They are quitting talking the Jewish language, chatter different sentences from various
                        “modern” authors, although they don’t understand what those authors write and say
                        - 
                        and as they get older and start talking about engagement, only then the parents, who
                        want to have a Jewish, pious son-in-law, see how bad they have become. The Jewish
                        
                        daughter, who only talks Polish and associates only with young people, who dress in
                        modern clothes with shaved bears, a long moustache and shining boots, looks at the
                        
                        young Jewish man, like any type of company, she doesn’t want to hear or know about
                        a Jewish engagement, and demands an “educated” young man, if not even a “German, son
                        
                        of a German” … If the father is strong enough to force the daughter to take the son-in-law
                        that he wants to have, he helps along to do something he has neglected until 
                        now. But sometimes, it is already too late. Or the daughter is “strong” enough, which
                        means she doesn’t have to listen to her father, she threatens to throw herself into
                        
                        the water, to drive far away in the country or - what has already often hurt - to
                        go into a monastery … until the father has to give in. But if the father stands by
                        
                        his opinion and doesn’t want to succumb, then the domestic peace is broken, there
                        is a grudge held between father and daughter, they live angrily and bitter. If the
                        
                        father wins, he forces his daughter <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="anchor-pb"></span><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="pb" source=""></span>to succumb, then she has a broken life with her husband, who she doesn’t like, if
                        the daughter wins, forces the father to succumb, 
                        then the parent’s life is embittered, they are not getting a son-in-law like they
                        want, later they will have a grandchild, they have to be ashamed of - and the beautiful
                        
                        Jewish family life what is praised by our enemies, gets broken…

                        These are the consequences of bad upbringing of our daughters. Besides that, the incredible

                        and brings some heads of the family, who could live in peace, poverty, and hardship.
                        Because the Jewish daughters who have gotten such an education has estranged with
                        her

                        need to give in, because the daughter is already a real “woman”, she talks Polish

                        world. The Russian government has now realised that, even as a big country as <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Russia</span> 
                        cannot defy the whole world, the persecution of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Chișinău</span> and these cruelties outraged the whole world, there were protests in the whole world. The American government 
                        even wanted to submit a written protest via their ambassador in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Petersburg</span>. But the Russian government didn’t want to do anything with all of that, it didn’t
                        want to 
                        accept the protests and let the joke of the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Chișinău</span> litigation happen, apparently to show the world: I herd you like cats! -

                        However now, as Russia is in conflict with Japan and war could break out any day,
                        the Russian government sees, that they cannot resist the 
                        whole world, no matter how strong they are. The whole world supports Japan, every
                        government wishes for Japan to be victorious, England and America might even help
                        
                        Japan and therefore, Russian’s allies, France, also stands on this side; Russia must
                        be afraid to lose in this war and then all the honour will be gone. Only now it has
                        to realise that it wasn’t the best idea to 
                        not ask anybody - and therefore fool the world. To now proof that Russia is not as
                        bad as it’s known, the meeting of the provinces has been called in to let the newspapers
                        know that they want to treat the Jewish people better now.

                        it. Russia has to <em>proof</em>, that it wants 
                        to treat the Jewish people better now, it doesn’t have to call in meetings and ask
                        for advice. It needs to act, it has to abolish the exception laws against Jewish people
                        and treat them humanly - only then there is a possibility 
                        of friendship with the world again, which it has lost caused by its harmful performance

                        being Hungarian, he did not grant. The greater part of the opposition also found peace
                        with this decision as well, merely some of the deportees don’t want to end this 
                        discussion and don’t want to give in the obstruction until the Hungarian command langauge
                        is being introduced as well, and the minister president cannot give this to them.
                        - That is why he decided to break the obstruction with force, he has announced in
                        parliament that if the opposition will not sign off the recruit law by , 
                        he will shut down the the imperial council and he will convene the delegation in order
                        for them to carry out the work, subsequently taking over the opposition by default.
                        
                        He will hold extensive sessions, he will introduce a new rules of procedure, and will
                        disolve the parliament as well as hold new elections if necessary. - The opposition
                        
                        still don’t want to give in, they declare not to be afraid to his threats. Several
                        members of the opposition have received threating letters claiming they will be shot

                        have to stay in the military and the reservists will be called upon. 
                        Nevertheless, they will not succumb. Who will win, the government or the opposition,

                        but Russia only has a small portion of their military in this part of Asia and is
                        unable to get all of their military there. Russia wanted to 
                        actually give in to Japan’s demands in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Korea</span>, but not in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>. Russia invested loads of money until they were able to 
                        get ahold of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>; to already give it up again would be a disgrace and shame. They would prefer going
                        to war rather than relinquishing 
                        voluntarily. However, England and Amerika are also interested in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span> and both support Japan in demanding <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Manchuria</span>, 
                        which is actually a Chinese province and Russia had occupied it with brute force,
                        should be free for all countries’ trade. And even if <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="anchor-pb"></span><span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="pb" source=""></span>Japan would lose the war with 
                        Russia, England and America will come to rescue. - How this will turn out in the near
                        future, maybe even in a few days, we will know if there will be war or if peace will
                        remain.

From <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Mainz</span>,  went to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Worms</span> and studied there under the great

He probably lived in the prayer house there which

                        <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rashi</span>’s time, the Christians went on a <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51649" target="_blank">crusade</a>, 
                        which means they travelled to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Israel</span> in order to take away the <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Holy Land</span> from the Turks. Jewish people have suffered tremendously because of the crusades
                        and the 
                        prosecution is today known as the “<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51651" target="_blank">Rhineland massacres</a>”.  The leader of the First Crusade, 
                         asked <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rashi</span> before departure if he 
                        would be prosperous. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rashi</span> told him he will win the war and become king of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Jerusalem</span>. But after that the Turks will come back to drive him away and he will 
                        return home with three horses only. In the end, it happened like that, the only difference
                        being that <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Godfrey</span> came back with four horses. He wanted to punish <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rashi</span>, because his 
                        prophecy was not completely fulfilled, as he came back with four horses. However,
                        as he arrived at the city gates, the gate suddenly fell and squashed one horse. Therefore,
                        <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rashi</span>`s prophecy came 
                        completely true. He immediately went to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rashi</span>, but he had already died and several rabbis carried out the burial rites.
