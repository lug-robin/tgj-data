            <head style="text-align:center;"><hi rend="bold">Our religious education</hi></head>
            <p>“One could almost laugh about it, if it wasn’t so sad”... We can justifiably use this general idiom in regards to the religious education at our public schools when accusing our advanced Jewish people 
               that our religious education is substantially neglected. Our children grow up without a Jewish consciousness concerning religion and faith, they do not know anything about the Jewry, about Jewish celebrations, 
               or about Jewish music. The educated Jewry then points to the religious education in the schools, that a religious educator is employed in every school who is paid by the Jewish community, that a representative 
               of the Jewish community sits in the local education authority, that according to the law the religious education is crucial in education. A student might be perfectly educated, but if he doesn’t know about 
               religion he will not pass the exam - because of all of that they know that the religious education is esteemed and highly renowned and everything is to be done in order to educate the children religiously. 
            </p>
            <p>All of those responses are correct. We have religious educators in every school - but nobody asks what kind of educators they are? We have representatives in the local education authorities, but nobody asks 
               how concerned they are with our religious inquiries? - The Jewish communities pay the teacher, but nobody asks how they care about the religious education? - The religious education is a significant subject 
               for every Jewish pupil, but nobody asks if it really happened that a Jewish student <pb/>failed an exam because he didn’t know anything about religion?
            </p>
            <p>
               The answer is: religious education in schools is a serious subject, but is not taught seriously. We don’t want to use a harsher expression, otherwise we would have to say: it is treated like a joke.
            </p>
            <p>
               The religious educator is for the most part not really pious. The children realise that he thinks little of religion and what he teaches. Therefore, the religious education doesn’t leave a big impression, 
               they don’t take it seriously and take religion solely as a story, which they don’t have to know anything about, like other historical chronicles. There isn’t really an alternative; for the most part they 
               are in school ignoring the Sabbath to learn writing, calculating and similar - how should they think about the Sabbath as honourable? And if the religious educator is a serious man, as those educators really 
               are, then he has a serious challenge with children of non-pious parents. For example, if he learns in school that eating <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1060878">Chametz</ref> is not allowed during 
               <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q121393">Passover</ref> - and that child goes home and eats Chametz , then goes back to school and explains that the teacher lied about Chametz  not being  forbidden 
               to eat .The same happens with the Sabbath observance and other big customs of the Jewish religion.
            </p>
            <p>
               But if a teacher who wants to take a stance against that and wants to convince the children that the religion he teaches is the true Jewry - then a fight against him rises. He gets reported to the Local 
               Education Administration, an investigation against him gets instigated and he is <pb/> being assaulted until he shuts up and is quiet.                
            </p>
            <p>
               However, a Jewish representative sits in the Local Education Administration, who should take on the teacher, because doesn’t he sit there for exactly that reason? You will of course ask, but that is indeed a bad 
               thing. The Jewish school inspector wants to demonstrate that he is a modern man, not a fanatic and only cares about the religion teacher if pious parents complain that the lessons are bad. But he will remain quiet 
               if someone complains that the teacher is too pious (usually a lawyer or a doctor or similar who has little knowledge of religion and is hardly pious), nobody should think only he is a “fanatic” under no circumstances…
            </p>
            <p>
               Not that anyone now thinks we are telling fairy tales, that we are suspected of lies. We want to bring facts which have been created in a big jewish community here in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs>.               
            </p>
           <p>
              A Jewish religious educator who came to the knowledge that Jewish students are sitting in school on Sabbath, asked the director he shall free the children from writing on Sabbath, as the law does allow that. The director sent 
              this inquiry to the LEA, which sent it to the board of the religious community, if writing on Sabbath is indeed prohibited. This inquiry has had an answer from the religious board for a few months now. They do not have the audacity 
              to say they should be writing; to say no on the other shames him, in case someone might say the board are fanatics!... We think that it is a bigger shame to be silent about this for so long.
           </p>
            <p>A second case happened in the same city: A Jewish teacher talked about the <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q837443">Law of Moses</ref>, the children reported this at home, some pious Jewish people told the school inspector and he initiated an investigation and 
               interrogated the children as witnesses. The Jewish doctor who is the representative in the LEA, who should have been most angered about the Jewish teacher, helped her and wanted to twist the children's answers with various 
               questions in order to make several pull back their statements. He didn't achieve this, but this case shows how far the interests of the Jewish representatives in the LEA go for the Jewish religion.
            </p>
            <p>
               Are those two tales proof enough, or should we describe more stories? - We don’t think that as necessary: every Jewish reader knows stories like this of their own experience. There are very little or even no Jewish religious 
               educators who are not complained about and there are few schools where stories like this don’t circulate.
            </p>
            <p>
               <cb/>However, we can say that the education in school according to the required methods, doesn’t get to the children. They stay unfamiliar with religion, its people and their faith.
            </p>

            <head>Letter from <rs type="place">Hungary</rs></head>
            <p>
               The Hungarian Jews, their lives, their political and economical situation, are not really known to our Jewish readers. The Hungarian Jew is a different “type”, he differs from the Polish and the German ones. 
               They live miles apart and don’t come in contact with each other. I’m not looking to describe Hungarian Jewish people in detail, their situation, their conditions and their states. I will do that in another 
               letter. I just want to share important information which will interest every Jew.
            </p>
            <p>
               In <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> live - beside <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q133032">Magyars</ref> - several other tribes, like Germans, Romanians, Slowakians, Croatians, Ruthenians and others.
               Together they would be the majority in the whole populace and the Magyars do know that if all those tribes get together, <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> would not be a Magyarianian state, nor a Slavish one. 
               Therefore they strive to strengthen the Magyarian populace, suppress the other nationalities, refuse them their national pride and don’t let them develop their national interests. The Jewish people in 
               <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> are always loyal to the government, supporting it in every situation and above all, the government has always got massive support during elections in the cities, where many Jewish 
               people live among Romanians and Slavic people. Without Jewish people, Slavic people would have been elected into the government. Where few Hungarians live, Jewish people help Hungarians to a successful election.
            </p>
            <p>
               Furthermore, the Jewish people in <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> can influence the government in certain ways and if they want something, they have the power to do so. Still, there have been some cases where the 
               government issued laws, which harmed Jewish people there. The last minister president <rs type="person"><ref  source="person034">Kálmán Széll</ref></rs> allowed Christians to open shops and banks in frontier districts where a lot of Jewish 
               people live among Ruthenians and Slavs in order to support the populace there. That harmed the Jewish people there. As soon as they opposed it, the government had to stop. Jewish people seem to have a bit more 
               influence in <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> compared to other countries.
            </p>
            <p>
               This influence also proved useful in the case of the Sunday rest. Many pious Jewish people, especially in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs>, suffer under the law of Sunday Rest. They close their shop on Sabbath 
               and also have to do so on Sunday. Closing their stores two days a week is difficult, especially for the little merchant. The Hungarian Jewish people managed to achieve some relief.
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb/>A few months ago, the government issued a decree for every tobacco shop to be open for business on Sabbath. The licence is to be revoked of those who keep it closed on Sabbath. This decree has been a 
               serious “punishment”. Several tobacconists, who didn’t want their licence to be revoked, and have therefore violated Sabbath. However, many pious Jewish people insisted and have not lost their livelihood over 
               this. The Jewish people have raised tumult: they have handed over petitions to the finance minister. Last week he gave confirmation to the chancellery of Orthodox Jews in Budapest that he meets half of their 
               demands. That means: he issued another decree that those who ran their shops before the previous decree may close their shops on Sabbath. And those who have had their licences revoked, will get it back. Still, 
               tobacconists who get their licence now have to vow to keep their shop open on Sabbath. In other words, pious Jewish people cannot open tobacco shops anymore…
            </p>
            <p>
               The minister has already written to the chancellery that he cannot back down anymore and they cannot ask for more. However, the pious Jewish people of Hungary must not remain silent and have to use all means
               at their disposal to abolish the rest of this punishment. If the government doesn’t want to give in, they have to turn to the parliament. And if that doesn’t help as well they have to submit to our Lord, 
               King … and they will hopefully achieve everything. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Jewish people have made Romanians and Slavs their enemies because they have always supported the government! In those places where a lot of Slavs live there is a great hostility between them and the Jewish 
               people there which leads to fights and brawls. I do not want to judge whether the Jewish people gain advantages for themselves by being devoted to the Magyars and therefore make enemies with the other peoples. 
               Maybe it would have been better for the Jewish people to stay neutral and not form alliances with any other nationality. I want to write about that another time. The Jewish people are already suffering because #
               they support the government and should therefore not make them suffer more. However, if the government forgets their duty, the Jewish people need to remind them as long as they are listened to.

            <head>The War
            <lb/>Between <rs type="place">Japan</rs> and <rs type="place">Russia</rs></head>
            <p>
               After lengthy negotiation going back and forth, the war between <rs type="place">Japan</rs> and <rs type="place">Russia</rs> has ultimately broken out. Both have hesitated a long time, waiting for the other 
               one to start the one so as to not bear the responsibility of inaugurating it. <cb/> Finally, Japan lost its patience and called back their ambassador from Petersburg immediately leading to war. The first few 
               days, news from Japanese victories at sea have been received. If Japan beats Russia at sea, the war will continue on the mainland. It is not clear yet how exactly both armies will crash against each other. 
               First of all, no one knows how fast both want to reach the capital of <rs type="place">Korea</rs>, <rs type="place">Seoul</rs>. It’s therefore possible that the first war on land will be happening in 
               <rs type="place">Korea</rs>. If Japan gets to occupy <rs type="place">Korea</rs> before the Russian military manages to get there, both enemies will already meet at the border of <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>. 
               The Japanese military plans to invade <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> in order to split the Russian military into two parts and weaken their forces. Japan moves particularly cautiously to invade <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> 
               in secret. They want to destroy Russian connections to their country, to demolish their railroads and cut their supply stream of food and war materials in order to facilitate the Japanese victory in the end.

               News of the first Japanese victories impressed the whole world, therefore leading to hope it would be easier for Japan to make peace. Japan will be content with their first victories and would be inclined 
               to make peace sooner. Russia was also scared of the war before it broke out and will certainly give in. Different sources talk about peace enforcement. Some say the <rs type="person"><ref source="person035">Pope [Pious X]</ref></rs> 
               will be the “mediator”, others talk about our <rs type="person"><ref source="person003">Emperor Franz Josef</ref></rs> being an arbitrator, but for now nothing of that is true. No one so far has come forward to mediate and nobody wants to. 
               - Every government declared themselves as “neutral”, meaning they are not supporting any party and just want to watch. Except for England, they support Japan in secret. There is a rumour that England won’t 
               let Russian ships pass through the <rs type="place">Mediterranean Sea</rs> to <rs type="place">East Asia</rs>, through the <rs type="place">Dardanellen</rs> or through the <rs type="place">Suez-Canal</rs>. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Russia is trying to receive loans, but after the first losses, there are doubts they will get money. 
            </p>
            <p>
               No one can say for sure how long the war will last, but it seems like it will end soon. A long war, which will not be cheap for Russia, will cause revolutions inside the country. Rumour has it there are preparations 
               for a revolution in <rs type="place">Russian Poland</rs> already. Therefore, Russia needs to end the war soon to keep its own country in check. The idiom: “The camel wanted horns, but cut off the ears as well” became 
               true for Russia now. Russia wanted <pb/> to invade foreign countries, but is now busy with its own land. 
            </p>
            <lb/>
            <p>
               The whole world is now curious how this war will end - if Russia or Japan will emerge as victor. Never before has everyone been so invested in a war, which is happening in a faraway country. Neither the war between 
               China and Japan ten years ago nor the war between Spain and America five years ago was in everyone’s mind like that because the end result was not important for the whole world. However, now, it is of great importance. 
               If Russia loses, its power will be forever broken, the dissatisfaction inside the country will grow. Either Russia has to issue a constitution and stop the tyrannical reign or revolutions will reign through the whole 
               country and bring it to ruins. If Japan loses, the chances to advance into a <hi rend="italic">Worldwar</hi> in all of <rs type="place">Europe</rs> and <rs type="place">Asia</rs> is tremendous. Nobody will support 
               Russia as every country is in conflict with them. Even their ally, France, is not happy with Russia’s occupation of <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>. Japan has England and America on their side, as Japan is waging 
               war for them as well. They want the same thing Japan does: for Russia to leave <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>. But if England and America support Japan, France will certainly not watch from afar. Then, Germany and 
               Italy also need to intervene, therefore developing the war into a world war, for which no one can know how that will end. 
            </p>
            <p>
               An important question now is the significance the Russian-Japanese war has in <rs type="place">Austria-Hungary</rs>. On the outside, Austria-Hungary and Russia are at peace, but the differences between those two countries 
               have not ceased to exist. Austria-Hungary has always been in conflict with Russia about Russia settling in Turkey and bothering Austria there. Austria can breathe a sigh of relief and act more freely in the Balkan, now that 
               Russia is occupied in Asia. The time has come for Austria to declare <rs type="place">Bosnia</rs> and <rs type="place">Herzegovina</rs> as its own. Until now, those two countries belonged to <rs type="place">Turkey</rs> while 
               Austria had merely occupied it. 
            </p>
            <p>
               There is another reason why Austria is interested in the Russian-Japanese War. As is known, Bulgaria intends to wage war with Turkey for a while now as <rs type="place">Macedonia</rs> belongs to <rs type="place">Bulgaria</rs>. 
               Additionally, <rs type="place">Montenegro</rs> is also constantly looking to involve Turkey in a conflict. Bulgaria and Montenegro hope to drive Turkey completely out of Europe. And if they lose the war, they may take no 
               damage from it like <rs type="place">Greece</rs> has taken no damage after losing the war with Turkey. The European powers did not let something bad happen to Greece. Even though Turkey has won the war, they had to give up 
               the island <hi rend="italic"><rs type="place">Crete</rs></hi>. Therefore, Bulgaria and Montenegro hope for the Christian powers to interfere in case they lose the war and take <rs type="place">Macedonia</rs> away from Turkey. 
               <rs type="place">Serbia</rs> has <cb/> not wanted to interfere with disputes on the <rs type="place">Balkan</rs> as long as <rs type="person"><ref source="person038">King Aleksandar [I of Serbia]</ref></rs> has ruled. However, since the revolution against 
               <rs type="person">King Aleksandar</rs> and the war of the new king, <rs type="person"><ref source="person037">King Peter [I of Serbia]</ref></rs>, dissatisfaction has risen in the 
               country. The king has not punished the murder of <rs type="person">King Aleksandar</rs> but started a war with Turkey to quench the discontent in the country.
            </p>
            <p>
               Until now, every <rs type="place">Balkan</rs> country was afraid to declare war on Turkey, because Austria-Hungary and Russia warned them not to start as they don’t want the situation in Turkey to change. But now, as Russia 
               is occupied in <rs type="place">Asia</rs>, the question is whether the <rs type="place">Balkan</rs> countries prepare for war. News came via telegram that Austria-Hungary needs to convene their reservists and prepare in case a 
               war breaks out in <rs type="place">Turkey</rs>. - The Russian-Japanese war can therefore have set off another war which is of great interest to Austria-Hungary as well as the whole world. - Besides, the whole world is greatly 
               interested in the war in Russia and expect daily news from the warside.

            <head>The first Russian defeat.</head>
            <p>
               Russia has already been harshly defeated in three battles on the ocean in the first few days of war. The first losses have shown that the Russian marines are not able to oppose the Japanese one on the water making one think the 
               war is as good as won to the benefit of Japan. Over half of the Russian ships which are in <rs type="place">East Asia</rs> have already been destroyed or at least have been incapacitated. Part of the other half are in the port 
               of <rs type="place"><hi rend="italic">Vladivostok</hi></rs> which is frozen over leading to the ships being stuck in there. The other part is stationed in <rs type="place">Port Arthur</rs>, this part alone is not strong enough 
               to combat Japan. Therefore, those ships will have to stay in the port and wait until Japan arrives to destroy the battle ships left. 
            </p>
            <p>
               The Japanese military showed their understanding of warfare, they proved courage and initiative. As eyewitnesses report, Japanese bullets and cannons always fired their shot and landed it as well, while the Russian projectiles 
               didn’t even hit their target once. - The start of the Russian-Japanese war seems similar to the start of the <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q12583">Spanish-American war</ref> some time ago. 
               Back then, the first battle also happened on the ocean, the American admiral <rs type="person"><ref source="person036"><hi rend="italic">Dewey</hi> [George]</ref></rs> destroyed the entire Spanish marine in front of the <rs type="place">Philippines</rs> 
               in one night and steered the war into the direction of the American victory. The Japanese-Russian war seems to go along these lines as well. Because of these first victories Japan managed to prevent the Russian marines from 
               reaching Korea and marching into <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> from there. The first battles on land will probably occur in <rs type="place">Korea</rs> or at the border to <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> and as it seems, 
               Japan will win. They are better prepared and show more courage. The Russians on the other hand have lost some of their courage after the first <pb/>losses and lost courage don’t fare well on the battlefield. When the troops fall, 
               they will fall.
            </p>
            <p>
               The whole world looks at the first victories of Japan with awe. It is known that the Japanese military training is highly advanced and they have proven great strength. However, rumour has it that there are <hi rend="italic">English officers</hi>
               on the ships who are dressed like the Japanese as to not be recognised and they are commanding the Japanese ships. If this is true, the admiration of the Japanese might is unwarranted as the English marine is the best in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
               More news followed the first Japanese victories.
               <lb/>The first message was fetched from a Russian gazette in <rs type="place">Petersburg</rs>, which reported on a telegram sent by admiral <rs type="person">Alekseyev [Yevgeni Ivanovich]</rs> - the Russian govenor in Asia - to the 
               <rs type="person">tsar [Nicholas II]</rs>:
               <lb/>“I have to inform about Japanese torpedo ships (ships that are tasked with destroying the enemy’s fleet) that were ambushing Russian war ships which were leaving the harbour of <rs type="place">Port Arthur</rs>. During this attack   
               <hi rend="italic">three ironclads have been destroyed: “Retvizan”, “Tsesarevich”, and “Pallada”</hi>.
            </p>
            <p>
               That is how the first message from the war side is written. One could imagine that if the Russian admiral delivered this telegram, the Russian loss must have been more severe as he has let on, as later sources described. The Japanese attacked 
               worked so well: the Russian battle ships shot back, but did not hit their targets and did not damage the Japanese. To caluclate the losses, it is important to understand what it means when an armed battle ship gets destroyed. Generally, an 
               armed battle ship is to be understood as an <hi rend="italic">entire army corps</hi>. A battle ship is worth 20 million. As Russia lost three battle ships during the first attack, it amounts to three corps and 60 million. Furthermore, 
               the loss of a ship is even greater, as building a ship like this takes years and years and the damage cannot be restored.
            </p>
            <p>
               All of Russia was shocked by the news of the first loss. The tsar’s ball has been cancelled because of it. The Russian stock plunged, the Russian enemies had a party, their allies grieved alongside them - but soon a new message about the 
               second Russian loss, which was even worse than the first one, was received.
            </p> 
            <p>The govener <rs type="person">Alekseyev</rs> sent the following telegram to the tsar: 
               <lb/>“On Monday, the Japanese troops, consiting of 15 battle ships, started to bomb the harbour of <rs type="place">Port Arthur</rs>. We shot back from the fortress. After one hour, the Japanese stopped firing arms and left the harbour. 
               Two officers and 54 soldiers are wounded, 10 soldiers have been killed. The Russian battle ships “Poltava”, “Diana”, “Askold”, and “Novik” have been <pb/> damaged. The fortress has not been badly damaged.”
            </p>
            <p>
               This is how the governor delivered the news, and everyone can therefore be certain that the Russian loss has been much worse. Again, four battleships were damaged, the fortress suffered. The second defeat was even worse than the first one.
            </p>
            <p>
               The third Japanese victory is also being reported on. At sea, next to the bay of <rs type="place">Chemulp'o</rs>, Russian and Japanese battleships went into battle. Japan demolished the battleships, “Korietz” and “Varyag”. Most of the crew 
               were able to save themselves, but in turn they were captured by Japan. The Japanese battleships have only been slightly damaged. According to the latest news, Japan managed to stop the Manchurian train and destroy it. This is another big 
               win as the Russian military deliveries are interrupted.
            </p> 
            <p>
               Generally, the Russian defeats are confirmed to be greater and showed that there is not one capable admiral on the Russian fronts. Russia is on the best path to be completely defeated at sea.

            <head>The causes of the war.</head>
            <p>
               The war between Russia and Japan broke out mainly because of <rs type="place">Korea</rs> and <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>. Meaning, Russia and Japan are not at war because of their own countries, but because of foreign ones. <rs type="place">Korea</rs> is a 
               small country, amassing 218,650 square kilometres with 10 million inhabitants. Those inhabitants are great fanatics, lazy, half-asleep and live like their ancestors a hundred years ago. The ruler of the country calls himself an “emperor”, but is in reality a 
               man without courage or power; foreign ambassadors do whatever they want. He is controlled by the Russian ambassador as well as the Japanese, the English and the American one, and even by women. A Russian cook and an English governess influence him greatly. 
               He just lets it all happen. Up until 10 years ago, China had the biggest authority in Korea, formally it belonged to <rs type="place">China</rs>. Because of Korea, the last Chinese-Japanese war, where Japan emerged as victor, broke out as well. Back then, 
               Japan wanted to take all of Korea, but the allied powers of Germany, Russia, and France interfered and forced Japan to acknowledge <rs type="place">Korea</rs> as an independent state - not part of <rs type="place">China</rs>, not part of <rs type="place">Japan</rs>. 
               However, Japan needs Korea because of trade, it needs to settle their merchants there. After the war, Russia started to invade Korea and to cause problems for Japan causing the Russian-Japanese relationship to be strained and irritated. 
            </p>
            <p>
               After the last uprising in <rs type="place">China</rs>, the <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q150229">Boxer Rebellion</ref>, where the “Boxers” rose up against foreigners, every country sent their military there to suppress the rebellion. 
               After the situation calmed down, everyone’s military retreated, except for Russia, which stayed in the Chinese province of <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>. Russia occupied this region during the rebellion and refused to retreat. At first, it was looking 
               for different excused, but the other <pb/> governments demanded Russia to vacate the area - after that Russia forced China to enter in an agreement after which Russia is allowed to keep occupying the province <rs type="place">Manchuaria</rs> as long as it wants to. 
               <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> should continue to be a Chinese province only by name. Because of the occupation of <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>, Russia became a closer neighbour to Korea, which bothered Japan quite a lot. But also other governments are not 
               satisfied with this situation, mainly England and America, which are interested in <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> because of trade. Therefore, they put stones in Russia’s path and disrupted their trading. They wanted to close every Manchurian harbours for 
               foreign trade. Still, China went into agreement with several other governments allowing them to trade however much they want. England and America therefore drove Japan continuously to not let Russia fob them off. And Japan, who could be sure that it had two 
               big powers backing them up, demanded of Russia to relinquish any Korean influence and vacate <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>. The negotiations dragged on for months. Russia agreed to give up influence on Korea, but not to leave <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> - 
               but Japan demanded both. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Lately, Russia started to prepare for war in <rs type="place">Asia</rs>. Japan on the other side, also braced themselves for war. After a while, Japan realised that Russia took ages to answer Japan’s demand and hesitated for weeks on end, therefore only playing 
               for time in order to finish preparing for war. Hence, Japan called back their ambassador from <rs type="place">Petersburg</rs>, meaning Japan is not ready anymore to negotiate with Russia, meaning Japan will protect their rights with a blade. On Sunday then, 
               the <hi rend="italic">war</hi> began.

               <rs type="place">Japan</rs> mostly consists of mountains. There are several high mountains and even volcanoes, which means the mountain erupts fire. The climate there is healthy: in the summer there is a warm and moist south wind, in the winter it is cold, 
               harsh north wind. The population grows continuously. Each year it grows by 1/9. Every year, there are 350,000 marriages and 100,000 divorces. Each year over one million children are being born while 800,000 people die. Japan has a lot of big cities, for example 
               the capital, <rs type="place"><hi rend="italic">Tokyo</hi></rs> with 1,350,000 inhabitants, Osaka - 500,000, <rs type="place">Kyoto</rs> - 340,000, <rs type="place">Nogoya</rs> - 250,000, <rs type="place">Taiwan</rs> - 240,000, <rs type="place">Kōbe</rs> - 200,000, 
               <rs type="place">Yokohama</rs> - 200,000 and others. - The bigger part of the Japanese is a united people. They speak the same language, wear the same clothes, practise the same customs and religion. Concerning their looks, they are similar to Mongols. The men’s 
               average height is 158 cm and women’s 145 cm, their skin tone is of a light yellow, their hair is black as well as thick and strong, but their facial hair thin and weak. Some time ago they used to wear plaits like the Chinese, but since they got more civilised 
               they cut them off. The Japanese are known <cb/> are known for their cleanliness, they are kind, decent, and polite. Their children respect and honour their parents. There are several schools and a university in <rs type="place">Japan</rs>, where Hebrew is taught 
               as well. Over 800 newspapers and bulletins are published there. The press law is very strict. The Japanese people lead a moderate lifestyle, they mostly eat rice, millet, fish and similar, but not a lot of meat. Their clothes are made of linen, their houses are 
               lowly built and made out of wood, and the roofs are made out of shingles or covered with straw - very rarely bricks are used. As the houses are built very closely next to each other, fires can spread quickly. - Most Japanese live off of farming, livestock breeding, 
               and mining. As of recently, factories were being built which export their merchandise abroad. The arts are rather developed, Japanese paper, porcelain, and paintings are known all over the globe.

            <head>Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg. May his memory be a blessing.</head>
            <p style="center">
               (A historical retelling). <lb/> I
            </p>
            <p>
               This story we are telling here is historically true and happened in the old city of <rs type="place">Rothenburg</rs> in <rs type="place">Germany</rs>. In the thirteenth century - according to the Gregorian calendar - 
               the principality of <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130875">Hohenstauffen</ref> ruled in this city. The city was surrounded with high walls and moats and the royal palace is situated on a beautiful hill.  At this time the principality ruled over 
               the whole land because one prince was the brother in law of the Roman emperor [<rs type="person">Frederick II</rs>] - the ruler of Germany at that time. The German peoples were dissatisfied with their sovereign and were said to have 
               planned a rebellion. In 1285, the Count <rs type="person">[Eberhard I] of Wittenberg</rs> started a rebellion in order to dispose of Emperor <rs type="person">Rudolf [I]</rs>, but Rudolf forcefully suppressed the rebellion with his military.
            </p> 
            <p>
               The Jewish people in <rs type="pesron">Rothenburg</rs> were valued at that time and have been protected by the prince against the masses, which used to attack the Jewish people a lot. The clergyman incited 
               violence against the Jewish people. The principality was short on money and borrowed funds from the rich Jewish people leading to the principality protecting the Jewish people and letting no harm happen to 
               them. The principality therefore issued rights and privileges, forbidding anyone to do harm as they were the prince’s subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
               At that time, there was a Rabbi in <rs type="person">Rothenburg</rs>, <rs type="person">Rabbi <hi rend="italic">Meir</hi></rs> of <rs type="place">Worms</rs> - may his memory be a blessing. An important gaon, who spread <cb/>
               the light of the Torah across the whole country. He was also a knowledgeable scholar in various sciences and asked every important question for advice. He led his community with knowledge and in godliness. He was well-known 
               in all of <rs type="place">Germany</rs>, from all sides he was asked questions to receive the answers and what he said was accepted. He was so popular that he was just called “Meir of Rothenburg”. He also led a yeshiva where students from all 
               around came to study under him.
            </p>
            <p>
               As the prince of <rs type="place">Rothenburg</rs> heard how popular the Rabbi of his city was, he was delighted how prominent his city had become. He held the Rabbi in high regard and consulted with him on various 
               political questions as well as admired the intelligence and reasoning of the Meir of <rs type="place">Rothenburg</rs>.
            </p>
            <p>
               Only as the rebellion against Emperor <rs type="person">Rudolf</rs> broke out did the situation of the Jewish community deteriorate. The rebellion disturbed the order in the country, everyone did whatever 
               they wanted, ignored the law, and stole one another’s money - and everybody put the blame on the Jewish people to consume the funds. 
            </p>
            <p>
               During this time, the Meir of <rs type="place">Rothenburg</rs> ran circles around his wide, but low chambers, deep in thought. The rabbi has always - as he was an old man already - looked well, went upright, 
               was neither bent nor broken. Therefore, everyone admired him, but immediately saw that he looked anxious and sick. He was dressed in his silken long coat, with a silken belt - both dropped down to his feet - 
               on his head was a sable-hat, and in his hand he held a sceptre with a silver top. It was noticeable that he wanted to go somewhere. 
            </p>
            <p>
               A young student stood next to the table with great respect, but he could not hold himself back as he saw his frightened Rabbi and asked with quiet voice:
            </p>
            <p>
               “What worries you? I ask of you, my dear Rabbi, tell me why you are so scared and unhappy? I am not used to seeing you distressed like this. Forgive me, dearest Rabbi, that I dare to question you today. 
               But I am aware that you told me all your secrets as your student, so why do you remain silent today? It is not the first time you have been called to the prince, who holds you in high respect and always 
               welcomes you with mercy and grace. Why then are you so distressed?!
            </p>
            <p>
               “You are right, my dearest!” answered <rs type="person">Meir</rs>. Those who are confident do not need to be sad. However, I have been plagued by several fears. I think the good times for us Jews in 
               <rs type="place">Rothenburg</rs> are over and tough, sad days are to come. Our sun is setting and the darkest night is starting.”
               <lb/>The student was perplexed.
            </p>
            <p>
               Did you perhaps forget the horrible plague which is going around in the <rs type="place">Rhinelands</rs>, in <rs type="place">Bavaria</rs> and in the bordering countries?” The <rs type="person">Meir</rs> 
               asked him. “Did you forget the hardship under which our brothers suffered? Not only three years have gone by since the mob attacked our brothers in <rs type="place">Mainz</rs> and burnt them. In 
               <rs type="place">Munich</rs>, as well, a Jewish quarter was locked up and set on fire from all four sides and all Jewish people have been thrown into the fire afterwards - A messenger from the city 
               of <rs type="place">Oberwesel</rs> arrived yesterday and bore a horrible announcement: the clergymen there defamed the Jewish people there having slaughtered a Christian child in order to sacrifice 
               its blood for an offering. The clergymen set the people against the Jewish people with this false accusation which are scared of being outside now. If this slander is now believed by the mobs, then 
               heaven help us, massive hardship will come over Jewish people. Now, a rebellion broke out in the country, the revolutionists are not far from our lands. Wherever they go, they will unleash all of 
               their wrath <cb/>upon the Jewish people… This grim situation saddens me and I am very afraid why the prince called for me today”.               
            </p>
            <p>
               “Why my dearest Rabbi, are you afraid and forgot that God - praise the Lord - the guardian of <rs type="place">Jerusalem</rs> does not sleep?” - the student asked. “You are constantly aware that 
               God is our guard, up to today, he protects us and will also not leave us now!”
            </p>
            <p>
               “Of course, I know this, my child” - Meir answered “but I am telling you that it scares me. One of my acquaintances of the Christian court told me that some days ago a man arrived who I am fearful 
               of. As people have told me, the scoundrel <rs type="person">Kneppe</rs>, who has been chasing me like a snake, arrived.”
            </p>
            <p>
                All colour vanished from the face of the student as he heard the name of <rs type="person">Kneppe</rs>.
            </p>
            <p>
               And the Rabbi continued: “For some years already, this evildoer has been following us wherever we go. Every false accusation, every defamation, every evil law, every persecution stems from him. His 
               roots go back to us, but he is our greatest enemy. In his youth, he has studied under me, I raised him; but now he has turned his back and has become evil. He knows the Jewish ways and                
               <cb/>is aware how to pursue. Additionally, he was very furious as I was not giving him my only daughter for a wife. Three years ago he left my house and his faith and became the leader of the enemies 
               of Israel. Therefore, he certainly arrived at the royal court to destroy me and the whole community with it. That is what I am scared of. I will soon go to the prince and see whether my fear is justified.” 
            </p>
            <p>   
               <rs type="person">Asher</rs> was very shocked hearing the Rabbi’s words and had become curious to see the end of it all.
