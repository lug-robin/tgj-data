               what should be written according to his opinion, his view and his thoughts, about all the matters, that are concerning Jewish people as a whole, writing and reporting
               in a way, which does not harm our ultra-orthodox brothers. This paper is written in ordinary Jewish language, which everyone should understand, which hasn’t existed yet and this should be our newspaper.

            <p>
               Dear Editor!
            </p>
            <p>
               Your announcement that you are publishing a Jewish paper in ordinary Jewish native language, a newspaper which you are promising us in your program that it will only be written in a Yiddish format, 
               unlike every other newspaper sincerely simply delighted me - I have touched upon this matter several times and emphasized it at every possibility, that a Jewish paper in simple language is missing 
               for our Jewish people in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs> - some would claim that such a paper could not exist in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs> and that it cannot survive in any way, proof being that every 
               Jewish jargon newspaper in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs> had to give up very shortly after publishing the first time, they could not create an existence for themselves. But the reason for that is, 
               the big difference between those papers and yours is that they were edited and written by another class of writers, and “The Geniune Jew” on the other hand will be in another manner, those papers were 
               party journals, for example, Zionist, socialist, etc.  This on the other hand according to the program will be paper for the common Jew, it will publish articles from good writers, but in Jewish 
               manner, good stories, anecdotes from sages and heroes and historical events, which will interest our Jewish <cb/>audience. Summarised, the need for this type of newspaper is currently very acute.
            </p>
            <p>
               But still, I know very well, that that paper is missing, I know very well that you have a lot of enemies, one will also deter from disturbing your undertaking, because the paper will not be a 
               big advantage to your enemies. Anyways, the public will not be interested for Jewish matters, and everything that is Jewish is foreign. But you must be indifferent to all those obstacles, and 
               you should also not be bothered in your undertaking, you have to work bravely and enthusiastically for the benefit of the Jewish public.
            </p>
            <p>
               Baseless hatred cannot harm you, I also want to remind, in a pact that this will also encourage you for your undertaking not to fear and to come to the conviction: “Either you don’t need it or 
               it doesn’t help it”, as everyone says, “All beginnings are difficult” - how many stones have been laid in the way of your newspaper “The Voice of the religious”, but everything has been overcome. 
            </p>
            <p>
               It might also be that I alone have made a mistake, and you cannot say with certainty that your paper will not have enemies, perhaps it is wrong, there will be many good friends, who want to support 
               your work and furthermore give “gratitude”, the public will finally be convinced that this paper is the right organ that is needed in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs>. - <pb/>either way, you have to think 
               about creating a good paper, and not about upcoming opinion of everyone, you have to turn your hope to the Jewish public, who hopefully will understand the value of the “Geniune Jew”.

               “You can recognise them by their temple”. If we want to know, which damage the assimilation, the mingling with the other customs - has done to the Jewish peoples, we only need to look at the fruits 
               of the assimilation. Slowly, cautiously, step by step, the assimilation, what our “educated” Jewish people have called “progressive” and “culture”, has led the Jewry down a mountain. First, they have changed 
               the Jewish garment, afterwards the Jewish names, afterwards the Jewish language and at the end the entire religion…  when our blessed rabbis have written and fought against the assimilation, against 
               the wrong <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q472670">“Haskalah”</ref>, which blinds the eyes and confuses the thoughts, which has deceived the people, which will deliver the end of the whole movement to heresy in the religion 
               of God - they had been viewed as fanatics, they had been laughed at and mocked. Now, also the so-called Haskalahs have to admit that our ultra-orthodox brothers were right: the religious heresy has 
               indeed been a “small matter” now, it belongs to every day actions, that someone who is a religious heretic is too nice to a  job, an employment, too nice to a business, a wife or simply too nice to 
               “society”, too nice to his children - like he says - so that they don’t have to suffer for their Jewry like him. A “convert” as once been something very rare, it has both been for Jewish people and for non-Jewish people 
               alike an “event”, people talked and wrote about it - today this has all stopped: nowadays there are already so many baptised each year, that is has been necessary to publish a set of statistics each time.
            </p>
            <p>
               And thus, a statistic about the baptised Jewish people in <rs type="place">Vienna</rs> has been published now, from which we can see, that in one of the last years 551 Jewish people have been baptised in <rs type="place">Vienna</rs>, 
               namely 313 men and 238 women. In this statistic, the job and occupation of the baptised Jewish people has exactly been noted down and we found, for example, 72 girls under 30, of which most have surely been baptised on the 
               occasion of “love” to a Christian, which is the consequence of a non-Jewish upbringing of our daughters. We also find 84 baptisms of people, who work so-called freelance jobs, for example attorneys, 
               doctors, public officers, and such, also 51 students, so exactly those people, who have come across with Haskalah and progress and have hidden until the atheism. 
            </p>
            <p>
               And this public statistic has not made a huge impression at all. “When a person commits a crime again, he shall be punished!” People have gotten used to it, not only the baptised are not ashamed 
               with their actions, but also their families don’t see it as a disgrace to have a “Christian convert” in the family, it has already stopped being a stain in the family. “Have you heard, Mr. N. N. 
               has been baptised”, are Jewish people asking each other, completely indifferent, nobody gets worked up about it, nobody is surprised, but people think that what is going on is a daily occurrence. 
            </p>
            <p>
               <cb/>And who is at fault for this? We have to admit: the common Jew, the pious are also not completely free of every reproach. It has been tolerated in great Jewish communities, that a leader 
               (of the Jewish community) has been baptised and he stayed the leader, the Jewish society is still associating with the baptised, as if they still remained to be Jewish, people are still 
               getting married with them, they are still trading and walking together, people let them  represent them, people give them their children to teach them and such - because of they have lost 
               their shame because of that others have lost their shame as well, to imitate them or plan to do so. 
            </p>
            <p>
               But not that alone is the sole cause that the baptisms are rising more and more. there are deeper reasons present, that lead to baptisms. The poor upbringing of the youth, the religious 
               education in schools, which is only <hi rend="italic">education</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>, that means, the children study and study and nevertheless know nothing, the bad behaviour of the parents, 
               the carelessness of the community, the lack of scholars who preach with passion, who should work against the lack and indifference for religion with courage and energy. All of that 
               led to this atheism and in will not get better until our whole life will improve again, not for the worse like the reform-Jewish people caused, but for the better: <hi rend="italic">To return the crown back to the

               <rs type="place">Galicia</rs> is a poor country, there are no factories here, nothing proper is being produced in the country, there is a shortage of work and earnings, most of the money is 
               going abroad from where most goods are being imported. Each year ten, twenty thousand healthy, industrious people, who could be of use for the country, emigrate from <rs type="place">Galicia</rs> 
               to <rs type="place">America</rs> and other faraway countries, so they can choose a job and are able to earn a lot of money. A big part of those emigrants consists of Jewish people, who don’t have anything 
               to do in this country.
            </p>
            <p>
               Lately, people in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs> have started talking about creating new sources of income, societies are being created, gatherings are being convened and committees are being elected, 
               who pay attention to the question how to improve the financial situation. A <ref type="information" source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2908887">Bat Kol</ref> has been shared: “let’s support the domestic products” - whoever establishes a new business, who wants to build a 
               new factory, get subsidies and support, in order to be able to survive against the competition from abroad and keep existing. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Only for us Galician Jewish people everything is still calm and quiet, like it is not missing for us. Here, you don’t hear anything about that, nobody is thinking about new sources of income, to get our poor 
               brothers’ livelihood. While everywhere in the whole world the merchant, the industrialist, even the skilled craftsman and tradesman are respected and valued like public officials and <pb/>lawyers, us 
               Galician Jewish people, who are reproached being a nation of traders, even the merchant, the entrepreneur in a small business, everyone wants to make “doctors”, “public officials” out of our children, but 
               there are already so many and nowadays it is very hard for a Jew to become a public official, even a small one with a low salary. Besides, the Jewry also suffers because of that, because a merchant 
               can continue being a Jew, like a “doctor” or a “public official”. 
            </p>
            <p>
               The situation of the Galician Jewish people is even worse than the situation of other Galician peoples, for they are cared for by the state committee, different institutions, and associations like the 
               “Kulka Ralnitsche” and others. Many associations and committees care for them. We Jewish people are dependent on ourselves; nobody cares for us, and nobody worries about us. We do not 
               know if the effort of the various societies and committees will result in a working industry and factories in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs>, which will have a practical success or not. But one 
               thing we do know, there will be absolutely no benefit for us Jewish people resulting from that. 
            </p>
            <p>
               “If we don’t get that, what do we have?” If we don’t want to take care of ourselves, no one will. “Go and make a living for yourself!” said <rs type="person"><ref source="person011">King David</ref></rs> already. Therefore, it’s 
               time that Jewish committees should be made already, who should investigate creating new enterprises, who should give our poor brothers a livelihood. Here in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs>, there are 
               enough Jewish people who have assets and can found companies, from which hundreds of families can survive and don’t have to wander around abroad and be roaming around. Already, there is no luck left to be 
               found in <rs type="place">America</rs>, in <rs type="place">Hungary</rs>, in <rs type="place">Germany</rs>, in <rs type="place">England</rs>, the Polish and the Galician Jewish people are not welcome anymore, 
               they are not met with friendly faces and everyone wants to get rid of them. With a little bit of entrepreneurial spirit people in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs> can create livelihood for oneself and 
               others. The time and populace are ripe, and we have to make use of it. We have to fulfil our duties of being a citizen of <rs type="place">Babylon</rs> and especially as Jewish people.

               <hi rend="bold">The education of our daughters.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               A preacher once said as a joke that the appeal of the Pharao, King of <rs type="place">Egypt</rs> was, that the Jewish boys were tossed into water and 
               the girls should continue living, because the Pharao wanted to eliminate the Jewish people and he knew that as long as the Jewish people stay Jewish and hold on 
               to their Jewry, nothing can harm them, that’s why he said to drown newborns, but only the boys because the girls know little of being Jewish and can 
               therefore grow accustomed to <rs type="place">Egypt</rs> and learn its customs - therefore they have not disturbed his plan to eliminate the Jewish people. 
            </p>
            <p>
               <cb/>Still, there is a little bit of truth in this joke, if we look at the manner, how it was for us Jewish people in <rs type="place">Galicia</rs>, now for the pious people, 
               who raise daughters. But there is also a lot to complain about the education of our boys. We can see that the children raised in a Jewish manner are becoming less 
               and less. Also pious, honest parents sometimes don’t care too much about educating their children Jewish so it would plant the Jewish spirit and feel it in the young 
               hearts, and to awaken and maintain the love for their people, according to the Torah and our holy faith. But just the manner of our daughter’s education is already 
               quite bad, that it’s above all measures - and we find that in Jewish newspapers, which are not necessarily pious ones, complain often about this negligence - and 
               that’s justified.
            </p>
            <p>
               We often see that the fathers now let their children go to school which stops his teaching and leads to away from passionate education which educates
               them well and pious - the same father does not care about his daughters and as a formality offered an explanation: “Everyone who teaches their daughters the Torah, teaches 
               nonsense”. He forgets that that our late scholars have conveyed it very differently as he understands it. He lets his children go to school, they are learning "<hi rend="italic">religion</hi>" 
               from a teacher who himself is not pious and he can interpret the sacred texts, but he cannot uphold them… all of that he removes because going to school is the legal 
               obligation of everyone. But after they have finished already finished school, there is a completely new education, which the government does not force onto anybody and 
               what not only not harm the Jewry, but also the wealth, because <hi rend="italic">luxury</hi> will grow because of it… our daughters will then have to read bad and corrupt books which not even 
               children of other people.  They go and listen to talks and lectures about matters, they are not at all interested in, they only go there to get into the society life. 
               They are quitting talking the Jewish language, chatter different sentences from various “modern” authors, although they don’t understand what those authors write and say - 
               and as they get older and start talking about engagement, only then the parents, who want to have a Jewish, pious son-in-law, see how bad they have become. The Jewish 
               daughter, who only talks Polish and associates only with young people, who dress in modern clothes with shaved bears, a long moustache and shining boots, looks at the 
               young Jewish man, like any type of company, she doesn’t want to hear or know about a Jewish engagement, and demands an “educated” young man, if not even a “German, son 
               of a German” … If the father is strong enough to force the daughter to take the son-in-law that he wants to have, he helps along to do something he has neglected until 
               now. But sometimes, it is already too late. Or the daughter is “strong” enough, which means she doesn’t have to listen to her father, she threatens to throw herself into 
               the water, to drive far away in the country or - what has already often hurt - to go into a monastery … until the father has to give in. But if the father stands by 
               his opinion and doesn’t want to succumb, then the domestic peace is broken, there is a grudge held between father and daughter, they live angrily and bitter. If the 
               father wins, he forces his daughter <pb/>to succumb, then she has a broken life with her husband, who she doesn’t like, if the daughter wins, forces the father to succumb, 
               then the parent’s life is embittered, they are not getting a son-in-law like they want, later they will have a grandchild, they have to be ashamed of - and the beautiful 
               Jewish family life what is praised by our enemies, gets broken…
            </p>
            <p>
               These are the consequences of bad upbringing of our daughters. Besides that, the incredible luxury, which is a consequence of this upbringing, eats up the Jewish fortune 
               and brings some heads of the family, who could live in peace, poverty, and hardship. Because the Jewish daughters who have gotten such an education has estranged with her 
               parents, she doesn’t feel for them, she doesn’t understand them, she doesn’t want to know if the parents know or not - she needs to imitate all “fashion” and the parents 
               need to give in, because the daughter is already a real “woman”, she talks Polish and the parents need to respect her!...
               <lb/>  This cannot go on like this. We will write in a second article how this can be helped.

         <p>
            After the horrible persecution of <rs type="place">Chișinău</rs> and <rs type="place">Gomel</rs>, after the ridiculous comedy what was the 
            <ref type="information" source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1814439"><rs type="place">Chișinău</rs> progrom</ref>, which made the whole world indignant - do we all 
            of a sudden now hear that the government has called together all other provinces to an assembly, in which it is to be consulted if Jewish people should be allowed to live 
            in the whole country of <rs type="place">Russia</rs>, unlike now as they are crowded together in few provinces like chickens on the roost and only the best, for example those who are 
            in the highest tax brackets or graduates etc., can live in all of <rs type="place">Russia</rs>. Rumour has it, that several provinces are in favour of expanding the Jew’s rights to live 
            in <rs type="place">Russia</rs> as they cannot watch anymore at the misery and poverty, in which those Jewish people have to live in, and which are caused by living cramped like this and having 
            to rip bits out of each other’s mouths. The governor of <rs type="place">Bessarabia</rs>, <rs type="person"><ref source="person002">Prince <hi rend="italic">Urusov</hi> [Sergey Dmitriyevich]</ref></rs>, 
            was particularly fond of caring for Jewish people said: “The whole Jewish question is <rs type="place">Russia</rs> is only a consequence of the bad economical state in which Jewish people have to live 
            because of living so closely squeezed together that they should be allowed to expand their right of abode, so they would fare better and also to weaken the hatred towards them.”</p>
         <p>
            It must be really bad and bitter for Jewish people in <rs type="place">Russia</rs> that now Antisemites like those provinces now have pity towards them. That is the truth! The situation of the 
            Russian Jewish people is indeed very unfortunate, and it gets worse each day. However, we do not really believe that the government sincerely wants to actually help them. All of that consulting 
            done for the provinces is a joke in of itself, which has the purpose to palm off the world. The Russian government has now realised that, even as a big country as <rs type="place">Russia</rs> 
            cannot defy the whole world, the persecution of <rs type="place">Chișinău</rs> and these cruelties outraged the whole world, <cb/>there were protests in the whole world. The American government 
            even wanted to submit a written protest via their ambassador in <rs type="place">Petersburg</rs>. But the Russian government didn’t want to do anything with all of that, it didn’t want to 
            accept the protests and let the joke of the <rs type="place">Chișinău</rs> litigation happen, apparently to show the world: I herd you like cats! -
         </p>
         <p>
            However now, as Russia is in conflict with Japan and war could break out any day, the Russian government sees, that they cannot resist the 
            whole world, no matter how strong they are. The whole world supports Japan, every government wishes for Japan to be victorious, England and America might even help 
            Japan and therefore, Russian’s allies, France, also stands on this side; Russia must be afraid to lose in this war and then all the honour will be gone. Only now it has to realise that it wasn’t the best idea to 
            not ask anybody - and therefore fool the world. To now proof that Russia is not as bad as it’s known, the meeting of the provinces has been called in to let the newspapers know that they want to treat the Jewish people better now.
         </p>
         <p>
            But will that work? Will the world let itself be tricked again as it has been once already? - It doesn’t seem like it. - a liar as the world says correctly, nobody believes it. Russia has to <hi rend="italic">proof</hi>, that it wants 
            to treat the Jewish people better now, it doesn’t have to call in meetings and ask for advice. It needs to act, it has to abolish the exception laws against Jewish people and treat them humanly - only then there is a possibility 
            of friendship with the world again, which it has lost caused by its harmful performance and what it is missing severely now.

               The whole world is interested now in <rs type="place">Japan</rs>, with the small Asian island state, which is willing to risk waging 
               war against the giant and strong country of <rs type="place">Russia</rs> with which every European country is in conflict now, and the big Russia with its 
               great deal of military, cannons, and war ships, is in conflict with <rs type="place">Japan</rs> and tries very possibility to evade this war honourably. It 
               certainly would interest our readers now to get more knowledge about the Jewish community in <rs type="place">Japan</rs>, which until now the European reader 
               has not had a lot of knowledge about. 
            </p>
            <p>
               <rs type="place">Japan</rs> is an island state, it consists of 3850 big and smaller islands, which together amass to 412.400 km² (a bit smaller than 
               <rs type="place">Austria-Hungary</rs>). The Islands are situated in the corner of <rs type="place">East-Asia</rs> and border with <rs type="place">China</rs>, 
               <rs type="place">Korea</rs>, and the <rs type="place">Silent Ocean</rs> (<rs type="place">Pacific Ocean</rs>). <rs type="place">Japan</rs> has a population 
               of 46 million, mostly Japanese and very few foreigners. Every Japanese is liable for military service, as soon as he turns 20. In times of peace the 
               military counts 300,000 men, at war more than one million. The Japanese armada counts 65 battleships and cruise ships. The navy consists of 12,000 men. 
               The length of the railway system amounts to over 4,000 km, the length of the telegram lines over 14,000 km. In one year, the Japanese postal service 
               delivers almost over 500 million postal items. The Japanese merchant navy counts 880 ships <pb/>(including 500 steamboats), every year 7000 ships dock in 
               the Japanese port city. - The Japanese national debt amounts to 1.500 million crowns. The annual interest and repayment for this debt cost 200 million 
               crowns. Japan’s annual income comes to 1000 million crowns, as well as the expenses.
            </p>
            <p>
               <rs type="place">Japan</rs> is the only country in <rs type="place">Asia</rs> that has introduced a constitution. The emperor bares the title of “Mikado”. 
               The parliament is split into the house of commons (with 252 members) and a house of lords (with 300 members). The country is freely governed and is 
               generally speaking very progressive and can be counted as a European country. 
            </p>
            <p>
               For ten years, <rs type="place">Japan</rs> has waged war with <rs type="place">China</rs>, although <rs type="place">China</rs> is 10 times as big as 
               Japan but has still proven itself on the mainland and at sea. At the moment, <rs type="place">Japan</rs> is about to wage war 
               against Russia and even though <rs type="place">Russia</rs> is bigger, Japan will probably win, because it is better prepared to 
               wage war. Russia on the other hand is actually in conflict and if war doesn’t break out it will be because the big Russia 
               will succumb and give the small Japan what it wants.

               <rs type="place">Austria-Hungary</rs>: Despite all efforts of theAustrian and Hungarian govnerments they were not able to reconcile the different parties. In <rs type="place">Austria</rs>, 
               the Czech do not want to knock off any of their demands. They are dertermined to block the imperial council as long as possible, they will not permit regular council and negotiation until the 
               Czech language will be introduced as an official language in <rs type="place">Bohemia</rs> as well as establish a  Czech university in <rs type="place">Moravia</rs>. Lately, all negociations 
               that had been held let to no results, even what the <rs type="person"><ref source="person003">Emporer [Franz Joseph]</ref></rs> has said only to the vice president of the council, 
               <rs type="person"><ref source="person001"> Dr. <hi rend="italic">Žáček</hi> [Jan]</ref></rs> at the court ball, that the Czech people should strive to make peace, remained without success. The 
               Czech do not want to succumb. - The government cannot give way to the Czech though, because the German wanted to block and it would have been their own. - In the meantime, the Czech lost the 
               little trust they had in the government; they say that the current minister president <rs type="person"><ref source="person004">Dr. <hi rend="italic">Koerber</hi> [Ernest]</ref></rs> is not 
               capable of making peace and they demand that he should step down and another one should step up. However, the <rs type="person">Emperor [Franz Joseph]</rs> does not want to send him home until 
               they are sure that neither the Czech nor the German want to give way to the new minister president. But this is not for sure and it doesn’t make sense if there should be another minister. 
            </p>
            <p>
               In the meantime the imperial council has shut down and only the delegations are counceling. The delegation is only to concern itself with <hi rend="italic"> foreign</hi>   politics and with 
               military matters. But because a great deal of members of the imperial council and the manor house who are from different parties are part of the delegation and therefore they mainly talk about  
               <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> matters, about the dispute between the Czech and German, etc., and very little about foreign politics. Of course,  <cb/>nothing comes of this all this talking, 
               idle words remain, without a purpose or practical value. - Concurrently, the government reigns with <rs type="information" source="https://www.verfassungen.eu/hu/verf48.htm#Gesetzesartikel_XII:1867">[III.] § 14</rs>, 
               it is working as well as possible, it even wants to negotiate new trade contracts with German, and also the <ref type="information" source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q209601">Compromise with Hungary</ref> 
               by the means of § 14, and because the Czech treathen not to approve the recruit law this year, the government also wants to pass this law with § 14. 
            </p>
            <p>   
               However in   <rs type="place"><hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi></rs>,  there is not § 14. There, the government’s situation is a lot more difficult. The new minister president [of Hungary], 
               <rs type="person"><ref source="person005">Count <hi rend="italic">Tisza</hi> [István]</ref></rs> may have approved almost everything what the opposition wanted, solely the command langauge in <rs type="place">Hungary</rs> 
               being Hungarian, he did not grant. The greater part of the opposition also found peace with this decision as well, merely some of the deportees don’t want to end this 
               discussion and don’t want to give in the obstruction until the Hungarian command langauge is being introduced as well, and the minister president cannot give this to them.
               - That is why he decided to break the obstruction with force, he has announced in parliament that if the opposition will not sign off the recruit law by <rs type="date">February 3rd</rs>, 
               he will shut down the the imperial council and he will convene the delegation in order for them to carry out the work, subsequently taking over the opposition by default. 
               He will hold extensive sessions, he will introduce a new rules of procedure, and will disolve the parliament as well as hold new elections if necessary. - The opposition 
               still don’t want to give in, they declare not to be afraid to his threats. Several members of the opposition have received threating letters claiming they will be shot 
               if they don’t terminate with their obstruction, because those retired soldiers will have to stay in the military and the reservists will be called upon. 
               Nevertheless, they will not succumb. Who will win, the government or the opposition, is not yet certain.

               <rs type="place">Japan</rs> and <rs type="place">Russia</rs>: Recently, the news about the situation is   <rs type="place"><hi rend="italic">East Asia</hi></rs>  has not been clear. 
               Soon they will say that the war is unavoidable and shots could be heard at any moment. Then again there will be reported that is still hope for war to not break out. 
               However, one thing is for sure, both Russia and Japan stay armed and prepared for war. Russia still hesitates 
               as they are not as prepared for war and because they are intimidated as Japan is closer to the theatre of war and can send all their military to battle, 
               but Russia only has a small portion of their military in this part of Asia and is unable to get all of their military there. Russia wanted to 
               actually give in to Japan’s demands in <rs type="place">Korea</rs>, but not in <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>. Russia invested loads of money until they were able to 
               get ahold of <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>; to already give it up again would be a disgrace and shame. They would prefer going to war rather than relinquishing 
               voluntarily. However, England and Amerika are also interested in <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs> and both support Japan in demanding <rs type="place">Manchuria</rs>, 
               which is actually a Chinese province and Russia had occupied it with brute force, should be free for all countries’ trade. And even if <pb/>Japan would lose the war with 
               Russia, England and America will come to rescue. - How this will turn out in the near future, maybe even in a few days, we will know if there will be war or if peace will remain.

               (<rs type="place">Lviv</rs>). Lately, two important associations have been founded in our city. One society was founded by Russian Jewish people living here aiming to support the local 
               Russian Jewish people or those from Russia who are passing through Lviv as well as possible. - The second society is the "Association for Jewish merchants",  with the purpose to represent 
               Jewish merchants. - Best of luck and development to both of them.

               merchants would sell poor merchandise abroad and therefore the reputation of Austrian merchandise is sullied leading to no buyers. He also showed torn-up boots, which a 
               Jewish merchant wanted to export abroad. The delegation president Baron <rs type="person"><ref source="person006"><hi rend="italic">Gautsch</hi> [Paul]</ref></rs> called him to order several times and after <rs type="person">Schneider</rs> 
               said at the end that Jewish people are not humans he shut him down. The delegate Dr. <rs type="person"><ref source="person007"><hi rend="italic">Byk</hi> [Emil]</ref></rs> punished him severely. The president of our religious community

               - Many cities asked the government to allow Jewish people to live there for the sake of trade. The government now allowed Jewish people to stay in over 50 cities where it has been forbidden up until now.

            <p>
               Shortly, it has been 800 years since the celebrated Talmud scholar <hi rend="italic">Rabbi<rs type="person"> Shlomo Yitzchaki</rs></hi>, known as   <rs type="person"><hi rend="italic">Rashi</hi></rs> who has enlightened all 
               of the Jewry with his famous commentary on the Torah and the Talmud, has died.  The name <rs type="pesron">Rashi</rs> has well known to every Jew, every schoolboy knows him and also 
               <pb/>the biggest scholar, the biggest genius cannot desecrate his commentary. <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>’s 800th anniversary will be celebrated everywhere. A book will be published in his honour and a foundation will be made. 
            </p>
            <p>
               But only a small portion of the public, which have delighted themselves with his commentary of the Talmud-Thora, know more about Rashi, his life and his history, and therefore we think that everybody would be interested 
               to read a short biography about <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>.
            </p>
            <p>
               <rs type="person">Rashi</rs> was born during the fifth century in the fifth millennium (in the year 1028 according to the Christian calendar) in  <rs type="place"><hi rend="italic">Troyes</hi></rs> in <rs type="place">France</rs> 
               at the same time as the last gaon of <rs type="place">Babylon</rs> <rs type="person"><ref source="person016">Rabbi Hai [Goan]</ref></rs> died. The sun of the holy doctrine which has stopped shining in the East (<rs type="place">Babylon</rs>), has started to rise 
               again in <rs type="place">Troyes</rs> (<rs type="place">France</rs>). <rs type="person">Rashi</rs> comes from a family of scholars. His father was a great Talmud scholar, his mother was a sister of the well 
               known Rabbi <rs type="person"><ref source="person017">Simeon bar Isaac</ref></rs>, who has written a lot of poems. In his youth, <rs type="person">Rashi</rs> went to <rs type="place">Mainz</rs> (<rs type="place">Germany</rs>) where at that 
               time was an important rabbinical academy where <rs type="person"><ref source="person018">Gerschom ben Jehuda</ref></rs> taught, and now during <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>’s time, Rabbi <rs type="person">Yaakov ben Yadar</rs>, which 
               <rs type="person">Rashi</rs> has mentioned often in his commentary. From <rs type="place">Mainz</rs>, <rs type="persono">Rashi</rs> went to <rs type="place">Worms</rs> and studied there under the great 
               goan rabbi <rs type="person"><ref source="person020">Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi</ref></rs> and rabbi <rs type="person"><ref source="person021">Eleazar ben Jehuda</ref></rs>. After that he studied under rabbi 
               <rs type="person"><ref source="person022">Eliakim ben Meshullam</ref></rs> in <rs type="place">Speyer</rs> and from there he went back to <rs type="place">France</rs>, where he spread the light of his doctrine about the whole world.
            </p>
            <p>
               <rs type="person">Rashi</rs> was, as has been reported, rabbi and <rs type="information">rosh yeshiva</rs> for a long time in <rs type="place">Worms</rs>. He probably lived in the prayer house there which 
               is still standing today. A chair made of stone which has been found there is still being called “<rs type="person">Rashi</rs>’s Stuhl” [<rs type="person">Rashi</rs>’s chair].  A big A is carved into the wall of the prayer 
               house, as <rs type="person">Rashi</rs> used to show that A to his disciples who did not know something of the subject, meaning they have to start again from the top. 
            </p>
            <p>
               <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>’s commentary is the best, most clear-cut and easiest to understand of all commentaries of Talmud Torah, he has also written other important books, which were to be printed in <rs type="place">Speyer</rs>, 
               some of them have not been printed yet and will only be printed to his 800th anniversary. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Nowadays, <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>’s wonders are still being talked about. We only want to talk about one miracle. During <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>’s time, the Christians went on a <ref type="information" source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51649">crusade</ref>, 
               which means they travelled to <rs type="place">Israel</rs> in order to take away the <rs type="place">Holy Land</rs> from the Turks. Jewish people have suffered tremendously because of the crusades and the 
               prosecution is today known as the “<ref type="information" source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q51651">Rhineland massacres</ref>”.  The leader of the First Crusade, 
               <rs type="person023"><ref source="person">Godfrey of Bouillon</ref></rs> asked <rs type="person">Rashi</rs> before departure if he 
               would be prosperous. <rs type="person">Rashi</rs> told him he will win the war and become king of <rs type="place">Jerusalem</rs>. But after that the Turks will come back to drive him away and he will 
               return home with three horses only. In the end, it happened like that, the only difference being that <rs type="person">Godfrey</rs> came back with four horses. He wanted to punish <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>, because his 
               prophecy was not completely fulfilled, as he came back with four horses. However, as he arrived at the city gates, the gate suddenly fell and squashed one horse. Therefore, <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>`s prophecy came 
               completely true. He immediately went to <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>, but he had already died and several rabbis carried out the burial rites.
            </p>
            <p>
               <rs type="person">Rashi</rs> died in <date>4865</date> (<date>1105</date>) at the age of 77. He was working on his commentary to the Talmud Torah. His disciple and son in law rabbi <rs type="person"><ref source="person024">Judah ben Nathan</ref></rs> 
               has completed the commentary of the Torah. Another one of <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>’s sons in law, rabbi <rs type="person"><ref source="person025">Meir ben Samuel</ref></rs>, had three famous sons: rabbi 
               <rs type="person"><ref source="person026">Samuel ben Meir</ref></rs> (known as <rs type="person">RaShbaM</rs>), rabbi <rs type="person"><ref source="person027">Isaac ben Meir</ref></rs> (<rs type="person">RIvaM</rs>), 
               and rabbi <rs type="person"><ref source="person028">Tam [Jacob ben Meir]</ref></rs>. These three grandsons of <rs type="person">Rashi</rs>´s were the authors of the first appendix. 
            </p>
            <p>
               <cb/><rs type="person">Rashi</rs> did not have a son, he only had three daughters who got married to significant rabbis. Two of them we have already mentioned, the name of the third one is not known. 
            </p>
            <p>
               May the memory of the righteous be a blessing!
