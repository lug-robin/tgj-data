            <head><hi rend="bold">Cultus elections in <rs type="place"><ref source="place002">Lviv</ref></rs></hi></head>
            <p>
               A few weeks ago in “The Genuine Jew”, we printed an article touching upon the upcoming cultus elections in <rs type="place"><ref source="place002">Lviv</ref></rs>. The author proved how important this question is and how necessary it 
               has become for us Jews. We should show interest in this issue. However, up until today, our city keeps silent concerning this question. Nothing is heard about it, nobody talks about it as if it is something unimportant, not worth wasting any word on it. 
            </p>
            <p>
               I tried inquiring the reason for this silence, but no matter who I asked I got the same answer: “Why bother talking about it? Why bother doing anything about it? It won’t help anything. Everyone knows that whoever is wanted by the 
               campaigner will be elected. No agitation, assembly, or protest will help! Why should we make a fool out of ourselves? We will be laughed at after the elections anyways.”
            </p>
            <p>
               Are those claiming this right? Are they right in refraining from any activity and letting everything remain the same because they are unsure whether they win on their first go? It might be true that they won’t achieve bringing 
               order into our religious community right away. But are we automatically exempt from trying to improve things at all? “You do not have to finish the work, but you <cb/>are not freed from it” our religious leaders have already said. 
               If we cannot manage to introduce a new culture office on the first try, we will achieve it on the second or third go. But first, we have to start, otherwise it will never come to an end. 
            </p>
            <p>
               However, it is not completely true because these few campaigners do anything they want. Moreover, it is impossible to seize control. Of course, because of <hi rend="italic">these</hi> campaigners only <hi rend="italic">other</hi> 
               campaigners of the same kind come as well. Instead of ambitious overachievers, other ambitious overachievers arrive. It’s only about the function, not the subject. If the opposition, another party, wants Mr S. S. to be the cultus 
               officer, instead of Mr. N. N., then there is no chance of improvement. The people cannot be excited for single people. Something tangible has to be aimed for, a cultus programme has to be presented and the whole system has to be 
               changed. If we present the people with suggestions on how to improve our situation, we will be able to inspire the people for the elections. It will be apparent that the agitation works, that the campaigner’s powers will dwindle 
               and that not those men who are wanted by the campaigners will be elected, but those the people demand.

            <p>OSIAS H. WILF, <rs type="place"><ref source="place002">LEMBERG</ref></rs> <ref source="place003"><rs type="place">Sonnengasse 27</rs></ref>.</p>

            <p>
               A programme! That’s what’s missing. Every party has a meticulously constructed programme which clearly states what they want to do and what they demand.
            </p>
            <p>
               However, we pious Jews settle for complaining about how our current situation is bad, that the current conditions are not what they are supposed to be - but we don’t state what we want or demand. How then, do we think a municipality 
               should be led and administered - that is why our voice isn’t heard, that is why we don’t have any influence, that is why nobody is asking for us and doesn’t care for our wants, needs, and desires. 
            </p>
            <p>
               So, if we want to get our will in the upcoming elections, it is necessary to call a meeting and elect a committee which should work out a plain and detailed programme and publish it. Every Jew should know what we demand, what we are 
               missing and how our needs should be met. We don’t need to care about the specific people yet, we don’t need to choose our candidates yet; who should be elected, for what, with what objective and in what direction. - If we know what 
               we want to do, the Jewish voters will clearly know about it and the campaigners cannot work their magic. We will receive a cultus office how it ought to be. A <hi rend="italic">Jewish</hi> cultus office for a <hi rend="italic">Jewish</hi> 
               religious community. Not only in <hi rend="italic">name</hi>, but also in <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi>.
            </p>
            <p>
               Therefore, brothers, God-fearing and devout ones, pious and honest Jews, commence the movement, wake up and start caring a bit about for the benefit of the community - and may God bless the work of your hands.

               <rs type="place"><ref source="place232">Athens</ref></rs>. A Jew and a Greek had a dispute in the port city <rs type="place"><ref source="place233"><hi rend="italic">Kalamata</hi></ref></rs> which turned into a brawl in which the Greek was 
               killed. Several antisemites immediately started to yell that the Jews killed a Christian to use his blood for matzo. The people gathered in front of the house where the Jew lived and threw stones at it. The Jews lived in great fear, they 
               closed their doors and windows and hid in the attics and basements. The military needed to intervene and occupy the Jewish quarter. The mob was agitated and incited. The antisemitic papers stir up hatred against Jews and excesses are feared 
               to start in other Greek cities. 
            </p>
            <p>
               For a few years already, the antisemites have been thinking up stories for Passover, to refresh the old, foolish lies of ritual murders. No explanation or proof is helping. One word is enough for the mob to be ready to take revenge on the 
               Jews. A lot of Jewish lives have been<cb/> destroyed because of that. The Jewish people live in fear and terror. How long still, will the Jews be prosecuted ? !

            <p>
               <rs type="place"><ref source="place001">Austria-Hungary</ref></rs>. The Austrian parliament works jointly again for a bit more than a week. Almost every day, long sessions are held - but the consultations are without use or objective. The 
               Czechs are obstructing, spend whole days with stupid proposals and votes. For every little thing they request roll-call votes. This means: Every representative is called by their name and asked whether he votes “yes” or “no”. If a few of 
               these votes are requested in one day, the whole day is lost. Any persuasion the government tried in the Polish club  to coax the Czechs to let off the obstruction did not work. The Czechs stand in one place and claim: Until their demands 
               are not met, they will not stop with their blockage. Their main demands are: the internal administrative language in <rs type="place"><ref source="place026">Bohemia</ref></rs> should be Czech, meaning that the commerce between two courts 
               should be held in Czech. Then they demand a Czech university in <rs type="place"><ref source="place234">Brno</ref></rs> (the capital of <rs type="place"><ref source="place027">Moravia</ref></rs>). The Germans are against these postulations 
               and claim that once they budge, the Czechs will filibuster once more and the government will not be able to find a solution. - There has been a solution to fight the obstruction, namely changing the procedural rules. This means that any 
               and all points on the agenda allowing obstruction are to be changed; the roll-call votes and so one. This was supposed to be the right remedy. But we have seen in <rs type="place"><ref source="place009">Hungary</ref></rs> that merely 
               threatening to do so stopped the filibuster in parliament. 
            </p>
            <p>
               However, there’s a big difference between <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> and <rs type="place"><ref source="place009">Hungary</ref></rs>. In <rs type="place"><ref source="place009">Hungary</ref></rs> a majority 
               party sits in parliament, the government is therefore made up of members of the parliament. They are an important pillar and can do whatever they want, even with force. Then again in <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs> 
               the ministry consists of officers, the ministers were civil servants before. They did not have any commerce in parliament. The government is not only one main party, it has to rely on support from different parties from time to time. Soon 
               the Germans support it, soon the Polish, soon the Czechs do and so on. No one party can support changing the procedural rules completely. Each party has to count on filibustering themselves one time or another and they do not want to tie 
               their hands now in case they need them later. Moreover, the Germans don’t bother anymore. They fear that via changing the agenda
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:center" rend="bold">[2]</p><pb/>
            <p>
               obstruction will be made impossible and the government will give in to the Czechs, allowing all their demands and the Germans have to sit by and watch. 
            </p>
            <p>
               The government is at its loss. The minister president, <rs type="person">Dr <hi rend="italic"><ref source="person004">Kerber</ref></hi></rs> is a capable politician, but he cannot do anything against the parties’ perseverance. He is always 
               solving the situation by sending the parliament home and implements all laws via § 14. Still, he is still calling the parliament as a formality shortly and sends them home again if it becomes evident that it is incapable of functioning. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Paragraph 14 is a convenient resource. It says that if a law needs to be passed outside parliament meetings which cannot wait until the next meeting, the government can introduce it temporarily by imperial decree signed by all ministers. Then, 
               when the parliament meets again, it has to be presented to them for approval within four weeks. For now, the government has found a solution by passing the laws via § 14. Afterwards, the parliament is called and the law is presented to them. 
               Admittedly, the parliament does not hurry discussing it. That is why currently, for example, there are 64 of these imperial decrees which the government passed in the past year. But this does not matter. The decree has to only be presented 
               to the parliament by law. Whether the discussions are finished, is not mentioned in the legislation. Only if the parliament does not want to pass a law, it becomes null.
            </p>
            <p>
               This is the great political question: what controls Austrian internal politics. Several smaller questions are added to that. For example, the Italians have demanded for several years already, that an Italian university shall be built in 
               <rs type="place"><ref source="place064">Trieste</ref></rs>. At first, the government did not want to give in, but agreed to it finally, but only in principle. This means that the government promised to erect a university, not in 
               <rs type="place"><ref source="place064">Trieste</ref></rs>, but another city. Now, the government actually presented to the parliament a law by which an Italian university shall be built in <rs type="place"><ref source="place212">Rovereto</ref></rs>, 
               <rs type="place"><ref source="place235">Tyrol</ref></rs>. The government chose this city especially because mainly Italians live there while <rs type="place"><ref source="place064">Trieste</ref></rs> is inhabited by Slavs as well. Demonstrations 
               between Italians and Slavs because of that, but the Italians complain. They only want their university in <rs type="place"><ref source="place064">Trieste</ref></rs>, because <rs type="place"><ref source="place064">Trieste</ref></rs> is the 
               biggest Italian city in <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs>. Demonstrations are planned for all Italian cities and the Italian delegates threaten to obstruct as well if the government does not give in.

               The archbishop of <rs type="place"><ref source="place236">Olomouc</ref></rs>, <rs type="person">Dr <ref source="person120">Kohn</ref></rs> was forced to resign from his position by the <rs type="person"><ref source="person035">pope</ref></rs>. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Since he was elected to be the archbishop, he had a lot to do with minor ecclesiastes who agitated against him in gatherings and newspapers. He acted very strictly against the agitators. He escalated some<cb/> cases and the situation got worse to an 
               extent that the new pope called him to <rs type="place"><ref source="place107">Rome</ref></rs> to render an account about his operations. As it seems, the government agreed to discharge him because he was not liked by the government. The bishopric of 
               <rs type="place"><ref source="place236">Olomouc</ref></rs> is the biggest in <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs>. The local bishops (they also carry the title “prince spiritual”) are usually of the highest nobility - suddenly a 
               common citizen was elected - that disgruntled the nobility. All in all, the pope thanked him for his services, granted him 36,000 crowns in yearly pension and nominated him for cardinal. - In other countries, this case would clearly be seen as an 
               ecclesiastical matter which has no business with politics. However, in <rs type="place"><ref source="place236">Olomouc</ref></rs>, everything becomes political. Germans and Czechs alike live together, in the episcopal district of <rs type="place"><ref source="place236">Olomouc</ref></rs>. 
               The Germans demand a German bishop to be elected, the Czechs want a Czech one. And the government does not know what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
               All these small things together resulted in an inability to bring order to <rs type="place"><ref source="place025">Austria</ref></rs>. Either the Imperial Assembly has to be consulted privately and arrange new elections, hoping the new parliament will be 
               better. Or the government has to abdicate and a new government has to be appointed - hopefully the new government can establish order easier.

               In contrast, all is well in <rs type="place"><ref source="place009"><hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi></ref></rs>. The opposition relented, and the recruitment act for 1903 was approved. Soon, the makeship budget and the recruitment act for 1904 will be approved as well.

               The delegates will get together again in June to consult over the joined budget (assessment of earnings and expenses) for 1905. The Austrian government can be jealous of its Hungarian colleagues, but the Austrian peoples can still learn from

            <p>
               The Viennese paper “<ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15805615">Deutsches Volksblatt</ref>” printed an article not long ago about the wealth of Baron <rs type="person"><ref source="person122">Rothschild</ref></rs>, chief of the Viennese branch of the millionaire 
               family. Following was written in the article.
            </p> 
            <p>
               “This year’s balance of the Viennese house concluded with an active balance with a surplus of 11,116,594,672 crowns
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:center">[3]</p><pb/>
            <p>
               Therefore, the Viennese house alone owns more than 11 thousand million crowns! If we take an interest of only 4 % - although <rs type="person"><ref source="person122">Rothschild</ref></rs>, who is involved in 14 operations on a high level, receives likely more than 10 % - 
               the boss of the Viennese house receives a yearly income of around 440 million crowns. According to the Mairente (Austrian government bond), the Viennese chief “only” owns 124,264,000 crowns, but on the other hand more than 132 million crowns in Austrian gold reserves, 
               over 128 million in crown reserves, 122 million in bonds for the <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q466350">Elisabeth Railway</ref>, over 121 million in Hungarian crown rent with 4 %, 70 million in February rent and the current gigantic sum of over 200 million crowns! 
               <rs type="person"><ref source="person123">Albert Rothschild</ref></rs> additionally owns 28,500 <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q372974">North Railway</ref> shares which are valued at 179,550,000 crowns, 120,000 shares of the Viennese credit bank which are valued 
               at around 80 million. Rothschild also owns French securities valued at 1,231 million and English ones even at 2374 million. Estates and commodities are worth 165 million according to the assets of the industrial enterprises: oil springs, iron deposits, mines, [and so on italic].
            </p> 
            <p>
               To illustrate the <rs type="person"><ref source="person122">Rothschild</ref></rs> profitableness it is sufficient to provide one number: Baron <rs type="person"><ref source="person122">Rothschild</ref></rs>’s share in the oil springs in <rs type="place"><ref source="place238">Baku</ref></rs> 
               alone yielded a revenue of 98,289,865 crowns! These revenues alone are a fortune!”
            </p> 
            <p>
               The words of the “Deutsche Volksblatt” should not be believed even if you are an honest Jew. The “Deutsche Volksblatt” is the most antisemitic of all antisemitic papers in <rs type="place"><ref source="place007">Vienna</ref></rs>. Their chef and executive editor is the well-known 
               antisemite <rs type="person"><ref source="person124">Vergani</ref></rs>. The paper is world-famous and known as the “dumbest newspaper in Vienna”. When the Austrian <rs type="person"><ref source="person125">finance minister</ref></rs> was asked about the minimal taxes 
               <rs type="person"><ref source="person122">Rothschild</ref></rs> pays in comparison to his wealth based on this article, he answered that he did not count Rothschild’s money and is unaware where the “Deutsche Volksblatt” got these numbers from. Still, the public is included to believe 
               what “the dumbest paper in Vienna” and a German-American paper says in this case: 
            </p> 
            <p>
               The Viennese <rs type="person"><ref source="person122">Rothschild</ref></rs> alone has over 2 billion (2 thousand million) dollars of wealth. The American celebrities are too insignificant compared to that. Their richest, <rs type="person"><ref source="person126">Rockefeller</ref></rs> 
               is believed to still be far away from his first billion. However, is also the founder of the house <rs type="person"><ref source="person126">Rockefeller</ref></rs> while the dynasty <rs type="person"><ref source="person122">Rothschild</ref></rs> is in its third or fourth generation. 
               The notes of <rs type="person"><ref source="person122">Rothschild</ref></rs>’s wealth show that he owns over 4,000 million crowns in government bonds, but his ownership in oil springs is more profitable. The Londonese Rothschild specialised in mercury and copper.
            </p><cb/>
            <p>
               The undertakings of the American bigheads bring in more money than the <rs type="person"><ref source="person122">Rothschild</ref></rs>’s ones. They don't really care for funds as it doesn’t bring in the cash, petroleum yields more than 50 % for the Rockefellers, steel even more. 
               The American big capitalists will surpass the European ones as time goes on. But for now they need to be careful as they would be tapped on the fingers. <rs type="person"><ref source="person127">Morgan</ref></rs> experienced that last summer when he was pinned down with the Northern 
               Pacific Railway last summer. <rs type="person"><ref source="person122">Rothschild</ref></rs>, who influences the London market strongly, called him on the carpet and the American tycoon was forced to break it off with his domestic enemies.

               (A peculiar clock hand). Not long ago, a poor German <rs type="person"><ref source="person131">clock maker</ref></rs> crafted a clock hand on which he has worked for 19 years and it is viewed as one of the more peculiar things. The hand is encased in a glass frame and consists of 2,200 parts of which 112 are wheels. The hand shows seconds, minutes, hours, day, week, 
               month and year as well as the zodiac signs. The sun, the moon, stars including  dawn and sunset as well as the correct position of celestial bodies which show solar and lunar eclipses. The calendar is one of the weirder things on the clock because it is an everlasting and complete calendar which adjusts itself and displays every holiday of the upcoming year as they 
               are not always on the same day. A glass sphere represents the earth and mimics the same movements and the position of the seven planets. Over hundred movable pictures and figures extend the work and every quarter hour is announced by an angel on the left side of the field. Two angles strike the quarter hour which are situated at an angle. Farer behind two figures 
               appear symbolising the four ages of humans. On the right side the angel of death appears killing with his sword on the clock face. When the clock strikes the hour the middle aged angel appears from the second angle holding an hourglass. At the same time an angel appears from the right side and blows a trumpet. Allegorical figures are situated beneath a roof, symbolising 
               the seasons. On the left side is a rooster which starts flapping, craning its neck, opening his beak to scream three times five minutes before midday. In “spring”, the allegorical figure shows a cuckoo from above and a quail from the left side, screeching seven times in “summer”. An ox lying down on his knees symbolises “autumn” and “winter” is represented by a lion. 
               The clock also has a bell which plays melodies five minutes after the full hour, lasting a minute each. The work has twelve smaller bells and the music volute has 997 needles.

            <head><hi rend="bold">How people wrote in earlier times.</hi></head>
            <p>
               The paper on which we write and print nowadays is made out of rags. The way to process rags to paper was invented 900 years ago<cb/> and the invention got popular in Europe over 200 years ago now. Before paper was invented, humans wrote on papyrus which is still used for Torah scrolls or important documents. The old tribes wrote with a slate pencil on slat which were 
               covered in wax or with colour on woods and fabric. Although more often, humans wrote on leaves of a plant which grew in <rs type="place"><ref source="place013">Egypt</ref></rs> which was known as papyrus from which the word “paper” stems. papyrus trading was very popular in <rs type="place"><ref source="place013">Egypt</ref></rs> because the whole world obtained its writing material from there. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Papyrus looks like a simple reed which grows in the water. Papyrus likes shallow, still, and pure water. Its roots are thin and soft, but hardens and spreads all over the bottom of the pond and therefore not far from the roots leaves can still grow. Farther above the papyrus is smooth and sleek. Papyrus often grows up to 7 - 8 <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1559627">arshin</ref>
               in height. The top consists of many, green strands with soft, silken, aromatic blossoms. The stalk from top to bottom is covered with two membranes. One is very thin and white, the second one is dark green and harder. The old Egyptians made the papyrus from this soft membrane.
            </p>
            <p>
               At the beginning of autumn, once the plant is flowering, the uppermost skin can be carefully removed; but it is not ready for writing as it is too thin. The membrane is put on a marble table and another membrane is added on top of it, which is then watered with water. The art of production is draining the water once the sticky parts of the membranes connect and the membranes stick 
               to each other. Then the folded up paper can be dried and need to immediately be beaten with a small hammer and finally be flattened with elephant tusk. Therewith is the work finished and a long piece of paper with a width of three <ref source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2121867">vershok</ref>.
            </p>
            <p>
               In order to write on this now, it needs to be held like a scroll. A part is rolled out to write on it and as the writing goes on, one side of the papyrus is rolled in further while the other side is unraveled. It is non-profitable to cut the papyrus apart, bend on top of each or bind together to create books or booklets as the papyrus is too narrow and too much of the valuable material 
               would be lost. Poems and smaller traditional Jewish texts were written on the papyrus. That is why the writers and translators try to write in every corner of the papyrus. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Even nowadays papyrus scrolls were found in the Roman city <rs type="place"><ref source="place">Herculaneum</ref></rs> which was covered with ash during the great earthquake. Some of them are very smooth and thin showing that it is not far from one of the best kinds of paper.
            </p>
            <p>
               Today, papyrus became very rare, even in <rs type="place"><ref source="place013">Egypt</ref></rs> because the cheap paper renders papyrus unnecessary. However, long ago        
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:center">[6]</p><pb/>
            <p>
               papyrus was planted on the edge of the <rs type="place"><ref source="place248">Nile</ref></rs>. Papyrus is also present in the Italian island <rs type="place"><ref source="place249">Sicily</ref></rs>.
            </p>
            <p>
               Not far away from the city <rs type="place"><ref source="place250">Syracuse</ref></rs>, around two thousand years ago, the <rs type="person"><ref source="person132">ruler</ref> of Syracuse</rs> was gifted a seed of those valuable plants by the king of Egypt <rs type="person"><ref source="person133">Ptolemy</ref></rs>. The seeds started to flourish. Since then, papyrus has been growing in 
               this nice, warm climate of <rs type="place"><ref source="place249">Sicily</ref></rs>. The Syracuse inhabitants still produce papyrus to sell it as a rarity. But no matter how hard they try, they may never make paper as good as it was in old <rs type="place"><ref source="place013">Egypt</ref></rs>.

            <p>
               The <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">rabbi</ref></rs> noticed that everyone coming to him to talk also talked with his <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">daughter</ref></rs> and when they talked to her alone, she was very sad. This aggrieved the <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">rabbi</ref></rs>. He loved his <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">daughter</ref></rs> 
               because only she stayed with him as his <rs type="person"><ref source="person135">wife</ref></rs> died a few years ago. His three sons died during the great riots in <rs type="place"><ref source="place093">Frankfurt</ref></rs>. Only his only daughter <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> remained, a solace in his older years, because she was always very obedient. Even one 
               time when <rs type="person"><ref source="person054"><hi rend="italic">Kneppe</hi></ref></rs>, the baptised, wanted to take <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> for his wife before he was baptised. <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> did not immediately say yes, but as her father the <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">rabbi</ref></rs> did not 
               give his blessing <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> denied <rs type="person"><ref source="person054">Kneppe</ref></rs>. The same <rs type="person"><ref source="person054">Kneppe</ref></rs> was baptised out of annoyance and swore to take revenge on all Jews, mainly the <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">rabbi</ref></rs>. <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs>’s 
               father loved her dearly, because she was always very submissive. And as he noticed her sadness and she not wanting to tell him why, the <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">rabbi</ref></rs> was very hurt. So turned to his student <rs type="person"><ref source="person059">Asher</ref></rs>, who we already know from earlier, and said to him: 
            </p>
            <p>
               “My dear student, I do not need to prove my trust and love to you, I believe you are convinced. So why don’t you tell me what the cause of my daughter <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs>’s tribulations are and I also see the sadness in your eyes. Surely, your troubles stem from the same root. In short, my <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">daughter</ref></rs> does 
               not want to share her grief with me and also does not tell me what is burdening her. But you, my dear <rs type="person"><ref source="person059">Asher</ref></rs>, you understand that your silence causes even more pain and suffering. Now I bid you, with all the respect a student has to offer to his <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">rabbi</ref></rs>, to tell me everything. 
            </p>
            <p>
               The student <rs type="person"><ref source="person059">Asher</ref></rs> answered: I want to follow you, my esteemed <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">rabbi</ref></rs> and I want to tell you everything: Since you have been with the prince and heard what he demands, that the Jewish people have to contribute a huge sum to the war, we see the villain <rs type="person"><ref source="person054">Kneppe</ref></rs> 
               making circles around our house. He lurks and spies upon us at every turn. I for myself am not afraid of him, because I do not believe he will find anything of merit to make us liable. But I am scared in case he is looking for your daughter <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> and might want to steal her away. Four times already they have met where he wanted to<cb/> obstruct her passage. 
               She was frightened and ran away. Even in the night he met her with her maid when she went to visit a friend. The convert said to the maid: “Go on further, I need to talk to your mistress”. <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> wanted to run away, but he held her back and did not let her continue walking until she said what he wanted to hear. First, he was talking friendly with her and 
               told her that he was only baptised because of her tenacity; because you did not want to give her to him as his wife. Then he started to threaten her and said: “You should know that I have a hold over you, your father, and your people. Now is still time to save yourself. I am sure that your father is not able to raise all of the money which is demanded of him. But you can save your father. Agree to 
               be my wife and I will persuade the prince to leave you be. You will be honored and appreciated.”
            </p>
            <p>
               “And what did <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> answer the convert?” - the <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">rabbi</ref></rs> asked.
            </p>
            <p>
               “She was startled and agitated” - the student answered - that she froze like marble and could not reply at all. However, <rs type="person"><ref source="person054">Kneppe</ref></rs> started talking anew and stated angrily: “Answer me, stupid girl! Let me hear your opinion!” <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> frightened even more and wanted to tear her arm away, but he held her 
               tightly and yelled: “You should know that if you don’t go with me willingly, your father will be severely punished and I will conquer you anyways. You can still follow and we will run away anyway, to a far away country. There I will convert to Judaism again and will marry you in conformity with the law of <rs type="place"><ref source="place034">Israel</ref></rs>.” <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> 
               did not want to listen to him any further and started to scream for help. She became afraid in case the convert wanted to harm her. In one minute I was with her, punched <rs type="person"><ref source="person054">Kneppe</ref></rs> so hard in the chest that he lost his consciousness and quickly fled the scene and ran to her aunt <rs type="person"><ref source="person136">Hannah</ref></rs>. It took over two 
               hours until <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> had calmed down. - All of this, my honoured <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">rabbi</ref></rs>, is the reason why we are constantly this agitated and sad. Now, <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">rabbi</ref></rs>, give us advice on how to save <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs>”. 
            </p>
            <p>
               <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">Meir</ref></rs> stayed seated on his chear, very nervous and thoughtful. After a few minutes he asked his student: “Tell me, why were you in the same alleyway as <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> and what did you do there?”
            </p>
            <p>
               “I want to tell you the truth” - the student answered “that the maid who went with <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs> saw that <rs type="person"><ref source="person054">Kneppe</ref></rs> attacked her and quickly ran to me as she wanted me to free her, but she could not find me at home. I was already after her on my own because my heart told me that something bad will happen.”
            </p>
            <p>
               “You shall be blessed by God” - answered <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">Meir</ref></rs> - you have saved and freed her. Now, leave me alone and let me think and contemplate what we should do now”.
            </p>
            <p>
               <rs type="person"><ref source="person059">Asher</ref></rs> went away and <rs type="person"><ref source="person046">Meir</ref></rs> called for his daughter <rs type="person"><ref source="person134">Sarah</ref></rs>. She soon came.
