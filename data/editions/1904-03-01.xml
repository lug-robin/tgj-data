            <p> Out of all Jewish holidays, <ref type="information"
                  source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q180115">Purim</ref> is the only one where
               Jews celebrate in remembrance of taking revenge on their enemies. The idea of
               vengeance is admittedly foreign to the Jewish people, as it is explicitly in the holy
               Thora: “You shall not take revenge and you shall not bear a grudge!” But against <ref
                  source="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q372091">Amalek</ref> and his children, who
               want to destroy the Jewish people, against enemies like that is the thought of
               vengeance, of revenge permitted. The positive commandment: “Remember what Amalek did
               to you.” delays “You shall not take revenge and you shall not bear a grudge!” for
               now. </p>
            <p> The children of Amalek are still alive to this day. “In every generation, they rise
               up against us to destroy us ( בכל דור ודור קמים עלינו לכלותינו" (Bechol Dor V'Dor
               Kamim Aleinu L'cholotenu))”, in every generation they rise up against us in order to
               destroy us, but “והקב״ה מצילנו מידם" (V'ha'Kadosh Baruch Hu Motzi'lenu Meyadem), God
               saves us from their hands. In His great revenge, we are not responsible, but they are
               avenged upon by another hand in the end. </p>
            <p>Lately, Russia plays the role of Amalek. In <rs type="place"><ref source="place014"
                     >Russia</ref></rs>, Jewish people are pursued the most, they are prosecuted
               most, they are tormented. The whole world was shocked by the horrible acts of
               violence against Jews in <rs type="place"><ref source="place015">Chișinău</ref></rs>.
               Brutality on this level has not happened for hundreds of years, but God, blessed be
               He: “Pull long and pay little”. As a proverb describes: Because Russia thinks it can
               do whatever it wants without agitating anything, the same Russia will see its end
               because of Japan. Every day, new messages arrive of the Russian defeat and the
               Japanese victories, it is truly the downfall of Hama. ( ממש מפּלת המן" (Memesh Miflat
               Haman). For Russia, also this quote will come true: “As you begin to fall, so shall
               you fall. (תּפּול" (K'asher ha'halot l'napol ken nafol tifol). As you begin to fall,
               so <cb/>you shall fall! Russia is being deserted from all sides, all its Asian
               neighbours, which used to ally with Russia - Korea, China, Tibet, and others - turned
               away. They are also looking forward to Russia’s losses and allied with Japan. The
               public opinion is also against Russia, looking forward to its defeat. </p>
            <p>Especially Jews in the whole world rejoice. News in <rs type="place"><ref
                     source="place008">America</ref></rs> reports that the local Jews want to buy a
               battleship with all supplies needed, cannons, gunpowder, and so on. They want to name
               it “Chișinău” and gift it to Japan. We do not know if this news is true, but it might
               as well be. “זכור את אשר עשה לך עמלק” (Remember what Amalek did to you) - we always
               have to remember this verse, we cannot forget the persecutions of <rs type="place"
                     ><ref source="place015">Chișinău</ref></rs>, not until Russia meets its end.
               Just like Spain, which once was the biggest empire and these days it pummeled and
               lost its standing. Our friendship with Japan is not מאהבת מרדכי (A friendship to
               Mordechai), because we do not converse with Japan at all. The Japanese are completely
               foreign to us and we have never been in contact with each other, except the same
               hatred of Haman. Our resentment against Russia makes Japan and us friends. We want
               Japan to triumph and therefore Russia should fall. The whole world will be convinced
               that there is a God who cares about the persecuted and punishes the persecutor. Then
               when Russia is like Haman, sad and cowering, then there will be light, and gladness,
               and joy, and honor for the Jews.</p>

            <head><hi rend="bold"> The Austrian Balkan Politics</hi></head>
            <p>Austrian’s Balkan Politics have been talked about a lot again lately; about which
               side Austria-Hungary will take in case a war between Turkey and Bulgaria breaks out.
               That question is not new. This question has been talked and written about for
               hundreds of years. Earlier, before Germany and Italy had been one great empire, but
               several small countries and kingdoms which did not live in peace, the Austrian agenda
               was mainly about intervening in their affairs and increasing the Austrian’s
               influence. From 1866 onwards, after the war between Austria and Prussia with Italy,
               Austria had to renounce any influence it could have had in the united Germany and
               Italy. From then on, Austria had two great, strong neighbours and has to be satisfied
               with being able to do what it can do alone. But now, Austria’s foreign politics can
               concentrate on Balkan politics again like it did in earlier centuries with its empire
               and Turkey. It is in the nature of every great empire to desire to increase their
               influence and greaten its borders. The grand global powers like England, France,
               Germany, and America strive towards conquering new countries in other parts of the
               world like Asia and Africa. Small Italy has won several oversea territories in
               Africa, even though it was done under great strain and with hardly any benefits.
               Russia is broadening their borders into Asia and if Russia is not hindered by Japan
               in the current war, Russia wants to become the main power of Asia.</p>
            <p>However, Austria, because of their geographical position, is not able to conquer
               other parts of the world. There are no pathways with the oceans and prepared to even
               do so. Austria can also not take anything from its neighbours, the great powers of
               Russia, Germany, and Italy. What remains is that part of the world: the small Balkan
               countries: Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Montenegro as well as old, weak Turkey.
               Austria wanted to take some of Turkey for itself wasn’t it for the other great powers
               standing in the way.</p>
            <p>Now, Austrian politics addresses the Balkan in depth once again. But not only the
               other powers stand in its way, also some of its own people are against it. The
               Germans do not want Austria to have any more slaves (Peoples on the Balkan are mostly
               slaves), as Austria would become a Slavic state causing the German influence to
               weaken. Hungarians are against it for the same reason, because they are scared of the
               slaves. Hungarians would prefer Austria to take Poland away from Russia. First, they
               could take revenge on Russia which helped suppress them in 1848. Second, the new
               Slavs Austria would gain come from the Austrian side, not the Hungarian one, like the
               Balkan countries.</p>
            <p>Having said the truth, Austrian politics might want to desire more of Poland -
               however, Russia is big and strong and is not to be messed with and <cb/>what remains
               is the Balkan. And now, Austria almost managed to win some land there. After the
               Russian-Turkish war of 1877, Austria got the approval of the Berlin Congress to
               occupy two Turkish lands with its military for an undisclosed amount of time: Bosnia
               and Herzegovina. Ostensibly, both countries remain Turkish, but Austria is occupying
               both to establish order there. Russia, always the holder of the Slavic peoples,
               agreed to this, because Russia already agreed to Austria gaining Bosnia-Herzegovina
               before the war so Austria would not interfere in the war.</p>
            <p>However later on, Russia regretted this whole thing: It realised that Russia had
               gained nothing in the war while investing huge amounts of money into people.
               Meanwhile, Austria, which did nothing at all, gained two countries. Russia started to
               hold resentment against Austria and watched Austria as well as paid close attention
               to the countries on the Balkan. Austria should not be able to gain any more land. </p>
            <p>To be clear, Bosnia and Herzegovina is not enough for Austria. These are two poor
               countries which only need to receive money. Austria also desires Macedonia with the
               port city Thessaloniki. If Austria took Thessaloniki in possession, it would gain
               access to the Black Sea, expand its trade and increase influence. But Russia stood in
               its path. Besides, Austrian politics sufficed to pay attention to the condition in
               the Balkan countries to stay as they are. That means, several small, but weak
               countries as to harm Austria should remain like this for a for years. Both Russia and
               Austria strive to gain influence there. Austria has the biggest authority in Armenia,
               Russia in Montenegro; the tables have turned in Bulgaria and Serbia. Some time
               Austria had more to say, some time Russia had more to say. Lately, both realised the
               great disorder prevailing in the Balkan countries. Every country does whatever they
               want as they are either reliant on Austria or Russia. Furthermore, both countries
               agreed to keep order and kept the Balkan countries to wage war with Turkey because of
               Macedonia. However, Turkey demanded to introduce reforms in Macedonia to reassure the
               Macedonians.</p>
            <p>The Turkish, the Balkan countries, the Macedonians - until now they all had to stay
               quiet. But now, as Russia’s hands are tied in Asia because of the war with Japan,
               they are starting to bestir again. Turkey gathered a lot of military, Bulgaria is
               getting ready for war, and the Macedonians are restarting their revolution again. </p>
            <p>And now the question remains: What will Austria do? - Voices multilaterally claim
               that Austria, which was not even afraid of Russia, will take the chance to occupy
               Macedonia and Thessaloniki. Austria’s government denies these allegations, mostly
               because it does not want to start off badly with Italy. Namely because Italy has also
               started to mingle in the Balkan affairs. It desires Albania. Austria on the other
               hand dislikes these schemes, because it does not want Italy to be its neighbour on
               all sides. But the<pb/>king of Italy is the son-in-law of a Montenegrin prince and
               sees itself as a big part of the families of the Balkan.</p>
            <p>In the end, it comes down to this: if a war breaks out on the Balkan, then Austria is
               going to use that opportunity to march into Macedonia with its military. It is going
               to occupy Serbia as well and King Peter will sit weak and alone on his throne, not
               being able to do anything. Russia will be indignant, but will also have to keep quiet
               temporarily. Only Turkey’s and Italy’s reactions are still unclear: Whether they are
               going to war with Austria or they want to reconcile with each other in peace. In any
