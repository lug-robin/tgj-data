                              and heavy suffering that it does not know where it is hurting. And as there are several
                              who feel and know how harmful it is, they need to shut up. They are afraid to say
                              something, they know that they want to scratch their eyes out when seeing the femininity
                              
                              of the Jewish daughters. What are they supposed to do? They watch everything in chopped
                              motions and stay silent.

                              do as well. They do not want to lose against others. Furthermore, we Jews are searching
                              for new taxes to pay as well. Under no circumstances can we let it happen that a 
                              government wants a tax of several guilds from every Jewish wedding. With what force
                              will this be implemented? It will be recorded, protested, called upon. Every Jewish
                              as well as Jewish-adjacent newspaper will write lengthy articles. Unbelievable! Has

                              receives 20 - 30 telegrams, the opulent weddings receive 100 - 200 and more. They
                              make a whole fuss out of it, but what for? Does it make any sense? It is very costly.
                              Jews 
                              do not know where to put their money!

                              have many rags with thousand coins dowry. First, they rent a lovely apartment, 2 -
                              3 rooms with nice furniture, carpets and rugs as well as several other things. At
                              that point 
                              they have already spent a huge part of the dowry and have already stepped towards
                              poverty. As soon as someone enters the door, he will be looked upon as a detrimental
                              thing, he could ruin the chairs, soil the carpets. Later, when a daughter has grown

                              by today’s Zeitgeist, she will not like her own home. She would like to store everything
                              anywhere. How can a Jew let someone in their home and who invites a poor person still?

                              In previous times, when one met a poor man, one befriended him. He would have been
                              treated friendly and brotherly, he was given the best meals. The poor man was satisfied
                              and could forget his poverty a bit. He started to like the rich men, the landlords
                              that 
                              once he got him he told how the rich man treated him, how good these people are. This
                              made a good impression on his children and they have become more humane as they realised
                              that there are good people left in the world. These days, the poor man comes home
                              and 
                              recounts how badly he has been treated. He is planting misanthropy, spite, and despair

                              of the throne for the parliament’s inauguration. The main venture of the government
                              for this season is to put through a bill which should forbid workers to enter and

                              to gain votes for the upcoming election. The Jews in high ranks do everything possible

                              the law from becoming so strict. If the law has to be passed it should at least be
                              as mild as possible. One can only hope that until the law is passed, it will be altered

                              Nobody wants to exclude good workers. It is still mainly affecting the good ones to

                              with the minister president’s answer and caused a scandal in parliament. They yelled,
                              rattled, and whistled - like in bygone days.

Six years ago, a Jewish girl with the name of <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="">Rosa Bürger</span> returned to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place149" target="_blank">Krakow</a></span>.

Her lover was a lesser clerk
                              who promised to make her luckiest girl in the world if she gets baptised. Her parents,

                              fallen people of the most beautiful families sacrificed themselves, sold out everything

                              for several years and knocked on the doors of Polish aristocrats - 
                              the highest officers in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place149" target="_blank">Krakow</a></span> and <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place007" target="_blank">Vienna</a></span>, but it was all for nothing. Everyone agreed and as soon as something happened, the
                              nuns cheated 
                              everyone. They sent the girl from city to city and no one found her until she returned
                              to <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place149" target="_blank">Krakow</a></span>, already baptised and already married to the clerk. The parents became sick caused
                              by shame 
                              and resentment. Not long ago a woman from the same town was in the hospital. Family
                              came to visit her. One time, everyone was at the sick woman’s bed and had a discussion.
                              Suddenly, they heard horrible crying from another room and the voice 
                              seemed very familiar. They look around and find a familiar travelling citizen lying
                              in the bed and ripping her hair out. The people were afraid to go to this traveller,
                              but she waved them over. As they were on her side, the woman poured out 
                              her heart. She told them how she got sick because of her hardships and that she already
                              received heart valves for her wails and lamentations. Her joy, she told them, has
                              lasted less than a year. Soon her husband forgot her, spent time with 
                              strangers and left her alone. Every day she had to work hard for one dry piece of
                              bread, without a friendly word, without any friends, without any sunshine in her life.
                              Soon her husband started drinking, always came home after half a night 
                              of drinking and beat her up horribly. Finally, he was arrested because he stole money
                              from his department and squandered it. Now, she was alone, poor, and forlorn; she
                              didn’t even have a piece of bread. Once she got very sick, she had to be 
                              admitted to the hospital otherwise she would have died from starvation. The Jewish
                              women let her talk and promised her that as soon as she is healthy again, they will
                              take her home with them back to her parents who will embrace her. However, 
                              the other day a hospital nun entered the room to speak with the “Jewish woman” and
                              she was moved to another room; the women do not know how or where she will end up.

                              Cancer is one of the most dangerous and most serious illnesses. Healing cancer is
                              impossible. For now the only way to save a person from death is surgery, but surgery
                              only helps in the first stage of cancer when it hasn’t spread through the body. Or
                              
                              if the cancer is located in a limb which can be cut off completely. Unfortunately,
                              cancer is almost never found in the early stages; when it is found it has usually
                              progressed far. And the risk is really high.

                              Cancer leads to death either by destroying an important part of the body or by debilitating
                              the body or by releasing vigorous poison into the flesh. The tumour is easy to cut
                              out with a knife, but it will soon spread out in new tumours.

But
                              the cancer is hardly ever cut out completely, the majority remains in the body. 
                              Either it is not found or the tumour takes over too much space in the body and the
                              surgeon has to put their knife down. Cancer grows well in the human body and spreads
                              more and more until it is lethal.

                              one can see that it is made up of small cells which grow in the human flesh. The cells
                              grow and multiply intensely, they spread with the ordinary 
                              cells of which the human flesh consists of and through which blood and other fluids
                              are transported through the body. The cancer grows and grows until only cancer remains
                              in the body. Then it starts to swell and decay.

                           <p id="p__12" class="yes-index">
                              Why and how it is growing those cells in the body - that question still remains unanswered.
                              Lately, a theory goes around that cancer stems from particularly small beings (microbes) which can neither be spotted with the blind eye nor with 
                              current enlargers. They transmitted the cancer onto other creatures to prove that
                              cancer, like any contagious disease, only stems from microbes. This hypothesis proves
                              that the microbes causing tumors are particular ones and if those microbes 
                              are cultivated the illness can be transferred to others. This hypothesis has been
                              put out into the world several times already, but stricter research proved that it
                              is too early to support this claim. In any case, this theory that special microbes
                              
                              cause cancer is becoming more certain. At the last medical congress in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place219" target="_blank">Wiesbaden</a></span>, professor <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person103" target="_blank">Leyden</a></span> said to have found the cancer microbe. 
                              Prof. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person103" target="_blank">Leyden</a></span> reckoned that cancer growth can only be explained by living organisms. The spread
                              of cancer, he said, is the same as every other disease of which we know. It has to
                              stem from microbes. 
                              Cancer causes the same change in the blood and the same bodily depletion. Prof. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person103" target="_blank">Leyden</a></span> also provides proof how the cancer was spread from one living creature to another.
                              It is very much possible 
                              that humans can also get infected but that is yet to be proven. He merely said that
                              he had met with a young doctor who once drank the juice of a tumour. After two years
                              the doctor got sick - stomach cancer. Prof. <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="persons entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="person103" target="_blank">Leyden</a></span> 
                              found special microbes in cancer patients which he thinks to be the cause of cancer.
                              They are found en masse under the skin and multiply heavily and grow into a big blister.
                              This blister bursts and new blisters with new microbes form.

                              Researching cancer is becoming more and more important, because more and more get
                              sick from cancer. In 1892, two out of every 100 dying in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""></span> died of cancer. In 1898, it already increased to three. 
                              Calculated differently, out of 100,000 living people 60 died of cancer in 1892. In
                              1898 this number rose to 71. In a period of seven years cancer grew to 18 %.

If they cannot collect 20,000 ducats in the

                              he did mention that his head alone is on the line for it, because the rabbi thought
                              if he conveyed this, everyone would give more than they can. But if all Jews are in
