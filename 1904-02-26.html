                              pious brothers, was fulfilled. Already, after 
                              three issues of “The Genuine Jew”, our paper has gained popularity among the people.
                              Starting on Thursday, people start to ask every tobacconist's, every bookstore and
                              even the editor’s office, whether the new edition 
                              has already arrived. Our readers can barely wait until the print has finished. Everything
                              is bought, for example, we have not a single copy left of No. 3, although we printed
                              a huge batch.</p>

                              people tell us that the audience, especially our Orthodox brothers who are the reason
                              we established the paper, are very satisfied. 
                              The articles mainly focusing on Jewish topics proved popular among the general public.
                              For the first time, there is a Jewish newspaper in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a></span> which every pious Jew 
                              can read, including his wife and children without having to fear to stray from the
                              path of righteousness.</p>

                              not understand them well. 
                              Therefore, if “The Genuine Jew” comes out twice a week, he will be able to  satisfy
                              his needs concerning a <em>Jewish</em> paper.</p>

                           <p id="p__2" class="yes-index">In the first articles of three issues of “The Genuine Jew” various writers rightfully
                              pointed at several important questions regarding Jewish existence which are not handled
                              as they should be. The writers allude 
                              to our ample negligence of Jewry as in every nook we are pointing to in order to criticize.
                              The upbringing of our children, our religious education, our rabbis; briefly speaking:
                              at home, in school and even in the 
                              rabbis’ dwellings. Everywhere is room for improvements and every writer asks: Who
                              is at fault?</p>
                           
                           <p id="p__4" class="yes-index">Who is at fault? Answering this question is not easy because we are all guilty: our
                              sons and our elders, young and old, we all are guilty that the Jewry is getting weaker and weaker. Our parents do not parent 
                              our children well. Our religion teachers teach badly. Even our rabbis do not have
                              any power, any influence. It has to become better here. Because of the rabbinical
                              question, are our rabbis without power or influence, 
                              they are dependent on our cultus board and therefore do not dare to open their mouth
                              and demand for things to improve.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p__4" class="yes-index">And here we come to our main conclusion to our question: Who is at fault? Guilty is
                              our cultus board, the leaders of our communities.  They are not taking a stance and
                              act correctly according to their duty.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p__5" class="yes-index">The communities act as  autonomous bodies. This means they have the right to manage
                              all affairs regarding their community on their own</p>
                           
                           <p align="center">[2]</p>
                           
                           <p id="p__9" class="yes-index">without anyone intervening. In any other nation an autonomous entity like this would
                              act in favour of its own people. It would use its force and influence to improve the
                              prevailing conditions. Here however, it is 
                              different. Our ministry of cultural affairs mainly consists of mere <em>chanceries</em>. Books are taken care of, they stipulate how things should be running. There is an
                              accountant, a cashier, and a 
                              controller. The council gets together every once in a while to talk about current
                              matters, a bit about politics, about the Landtag elections and things like that. But
                              they do not talk about Jewish matters, about 
                              the significant interests of the Jewish people - those are not discussed as if the
                              council is not responsible for them. </p>
                           
                           <p id="p__9" class="yes-index">
                              The cause of this is very simple. In most Galician cities, the majority of Jews living
                              there are pious ones. However, the electives in the ministry are mainly “progressive”
                              lawyers who are not particularly interested 
                              in Jewish matters. Whenever this council gets together in a meeting, they are clueless
                              what to do in favour of religion and faith. First of all, they do not know a lot about
                              it and do not know how to enact a remedy. 
                              Secondly, they are more progressive and cannot act against their own opinion of Jewry.
                              It is already sufficient if they do not do anything to harm Jewry as they are afraid
                              of the pious populace. More than that, 
                              everything is neglected. The council does not care about the religious education,
                              not about the rabbinical question, not about the תּלמוד־תּורה (Talmetoyre - a tuition-free
                              elementary school maintained by the community 
                              for poor children), they do not care about Jewish upbringing. Therefore, everything
                              here is foul and bad. 
                              </p>

                              Why do we talk about this whole thing here? Shortly, there will be an election for
                              the new board of culture in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place002" target="_blank">Lviv</a></span>, the capital of the country. The smaller towns 
                              look up to the big city and adapt themselves towards it. The state of the big city
                              has an influence on the small towns. If everything is working properly in the city,
                              everything will be alright in the smaller cities. 
                              Moreover, elections in a big community, a community of major cultural and religious
                              importance - like the one in <span  xmlns:local="http://dse-static.foo.bar" class="places entity " id="" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target=""><a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="place002" target="_blank">Lviv</a></span> - are significant for the whole country and 
                              have a bigger impact than just locally. The outcome of the elections can influence
                              the entire country -  for the better or for the worse. And we pious Jews need to see
                              that it will be better.</p>
                           
                           <p id="p__12" class="yes-index">We do not want to look into the programs and moreover single individuals and parties
                              yet. There still will be enough time for that. Today we want to concern ourselves
                              with the question in order to remind our pious 
                              brothers of the upcoming elections which are very important for the Jewry and to call on them to pay their overdue taxes in order to not lose their right to vote.
                              They should make an effort to attain as many votes 
                              as they can. For these elections, every vote has an immense value. This time they
                              need to use their voice for the benefit of the true Jewry. If we manage to improve
                              the situation in the ministry of culture and education, 
                              everything will gradually improve.</p>

                              I must admit that the impression my first article on pious family has made, was bigger
                              than I anticipated. This shows that I portrayed the situation correctly. The critique,
                              what I have criticised was right therefore. 
                              However, it is not as easy to point a way to improve the conditions. The main action
                              is for the parents to care more about their daughter’s education as much as they should
                              stick to the rule: “One who is created needs 
                              to marry, but does not need to live”. This means: do only men need to live piously?
                              Do only our sons need to be educated well, Jewish, and piously, but not our daughters?
                              Women today play a big role in our family life. 
                              Not only is the Jewry at home, the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q191498" target="_blank">kashrut</a>, the desecration of Sabbath, amongst other things, dependent on them, because the
                              men are busy making a living to 
                              take care of the household. They are not responsible for the children’s and particularly
                              the daughter’s upbringing, but if their daughters are not educated Jewish, one can
                              imagine them wanting to raise their daughters 
                              again. Still, the pious Jewry should strive to educate their daughters as well as
                              their sons. They have to see that their daughter’s do not leave school which is a
                              legal requirement which no one can withdraw from. 
                              They have to see that their daughter’s do not spend their days reading corrupt novels
                              which turn them bad. They have to see that their daughter’s educate themselves economically,
                              they should know cooking, baking, 
                              sewing, stitching and so on. It is necessary for every Jewish housewife to concern
                              themselves with this matter if they do not want to deal with  some blockhead, if they
                              do not want to be associated with bad company, 
                              and to not be unhappy with themselves and make their parents miserable. If they strive
                              for education and knowledge, they can gather enough Jewish knowledge. They can learn
                              to understand our prayers and our poems, 
                              learn a bit of Jewish history, they need to know how much the Jewish people have suffered
                              for their religion and their faith, how many martyrs have devoted themselves, were
                              burnt and drowned for our holy religion. 
                              They therefore should be planted deep in the young hearts, love, and respect for their
                              people, their religion, to their customs, and their performances. At that time, the
                              honest, pious Jew has not been the target 
                              of mockery, at that time they were not looked at like people from past generations,
                              at that time they felt what every pious Jew felt, back then they would know that they
                              are
