                           <p>
                              We are delighted to announce to our readers and our friends that our hope with “The
                              Genuine Jew”, to create a readership and be of use for our brothers, especially our
                              pious brothers, was fulfilled. Already, after 
                              three issues of “The Genuine Jew”, our paper has gained popularity among the people.
                              Starting on Thursday, people start to ask every tobacconist's, every bookstore and
                              even the editor’s office, whether the new edition 
                              has already arrived. Our readers can barely wait until the print has finished. Everything
                              is bought, for example, we have not a single copy left of No. 3, although we printed
                              a huge batch.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Not only the news about the war made people interested in this paper. From all over,
                              people tell us that the audience, especially our Orthodox brothers who are the reason
                              we established the paper, are very satisfied. 
                              The articles mainly focusing on Jewish topics proved popular among the general public.
                              For the first time, there is a Jewish newspaper in <a href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a> which every pious Jew 
                              can read, including his wife and children without having to fear to stray from the
                              path of righteousness.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The audience is content with us and we are content with the audience. This mutual
                              satisfaction allows us to improve and prosper our paper.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p align="center">- 2 -</p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Voices from different quarters ask for the paper to be released <em>daily</em>, but we want to follow what our scholars of blessed memories have said: “If you grasp
                              too much, you will grasp nothing” 
                              and not to put too much work on our backs. Therefore, we decided to first  carry out
                              a small test, namely: from next week on 
                              </p>

                           <p>
                              Friday will stay like it is now with the same content. On Tuesday, we will preliminarily
                              write about news from the war front, politics and similar topics our readers care
                              about and cannot wait for until Friday.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              We live in serious times. More wars will follow the war between <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> and <a href="place19" target="_blank">Japan</a>. The whole world, generally the Jew, 
                              is curious to know what happens around the globe. And if there is no Jewish press
                              he has to purchase newspapers in other languages which are more expensive and he might
                              not understand them well. 
                              Therefore, if “The Genuine Jew” comes out twice a week, he will be able to  satisfy
                              his needs concerning a <em>Jewish</em> paper.</p>

                           <p>
                              In the first articles of three issues of “The Genuine Jew” various writers rightfully
                              pointed at several important questions regarding Jewish existence which are not handled
                              as they should be. The writers allude 
                              to our ample negligence of Jewry as in every nook we are pointing to in order to criticize.
                              The upbringing of our children, our religious education, our rabbis; briefly speaking:
                              at home, in school and even in the 
                              rabbis’ dwellings. Everywhere is room for improvements and every writer asks: Who
                              is at fault?
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Who is at fault? Answering this question is not easy because we are all guilty: our
                              sons and our elders, young and old, we all are guilty that the Jewry is getting weaker and weaker. Our parents do not parent 
                              our children well. Our religion teachers teach badly. Even our rabbis do not have
                              any power, any influence. It has to become better here. Because of the rabbinical
                              question, are our rabbis without power or influence, 
                              they are dependent on our cultus board and therefore do not dare to open their mouth
                              and demand for things to improve.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              And here we come to our main conclusion to our question: Who is at fault? Guilty is
                              our cultus board, the leaders of our communities.  They are not taking a stance and
                              act correctly according to their duty.</p>
                           
                           <p>The communities act as  autonomous bodies. This means they have the right to manage
                              all affairs regarding their community on their own
                              </p>
                           
                           
                           <p align="center">- 3 -</p>            
                           
                           <p>
                              without anyone intervening. In any other nation an autonomous entity like this would
                              act in favour of its own people. It would use its force and influence to improve the
                              prevailing conditions. Here however, it is 
                              different. Our ministry of cultural affairs mainly consists of mere <em>chanceries</em>. Books are taken care of, they stipulate how things should be running. There is an
                              accountant, a cashier, and a 
                              controller. The council gets together every once in a while to talk about current
                              matters, a bit about politics, about the Landtag elections and things like that. But
                              they do not talk about Jewish matters, about 
                              the significant interests of the Jewish people - those are not discussed as if the
                              council is not responsible for them.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The cause of this is very simple. In most Galician cities, the majority of Jews living
                              there are pious ones. However, the electives in the ministry are mainly “progressive”
                              lawyers who are not particularly interested 
                              in Jewish matters. Whenever this council gets together in a meeting, they are clueless
                              what to do in favour of religion and faith. First of all, they do not know a lot about
                              it and do not know how to enact a remedy. 
                              Secondly, they are more progressive and cannot act against their own opinion of Jewry.
                              It is already sufficient if they do not do anything to harm Jewry as they are afraid
                              of the pious populace. More than that, 
                              everything is neglected. The council does not care about the religious education,
                              not about the rabbinical question, not about the Talmetoyre (a tuition-free elementary
                              school maintained by the community 
                              for poor children), they do not care about Jewish upbringing. Therefore, everything
                              here is foul and bad. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Why do we talk about this whole thing here? Shortly, there will be an election for
                              the new board of culture in <a href="place002" target="_blank">Lviv</a>, the capital of the country. The smaller towns 
                              look up to the big city and adapt themselves towards it. The state of the big city
                              has an influence on the small towns. If everything is working properly in the city,
                              everything will be alright in the smaller cities. 
                              Moreover, elections in a big community, a community of major cultural and religious
                              importance - like the one in <a href="place002" target="_blank">Lviv</a> - are significant for the whole country and 
                              have a bigger impact than just locally. The outcome of the elections can influence
                              the entire country -  for the better or for the worse. And we pious Jews need to see
                              that it will be better.</p>
                           
                           <p>We do not want to look into the programs and moreover single individuals and parties
                              yet. There still will be enough time for that. Today we want to concern ourselves
                              with the question in order to remind our pious 
                              brothers of the upcoming elections which are very important for the Jewry and to call on them to pay their overdue taxes in order to not lose their right to vote.
                              They should make an effort to attain as many votes 
                              as they can. For these elections, every vote has an immense value. This time they
                              need to use their voice for the benefit of the true Jewry. If we manage to improve
                              the situation in the ministry of culture and education, 
                              everything will gradually improve.

                           <p>
                              I must admit that the impression my first article on pious family has made, was bigger
                              than I anticipated. This shows that I portrayed the situation correctly. The critique,
                              what I have criticised was right therefore. 
                              However, it is not as easy to point a way to improve the conditions. The main action
                              is for the parents to care more about their daughter’s education as much as they should
                              stick to the rule: “One who is created needs 
                              to marry, but does not need to live”. This means: do only men need to live piously?
                              Do only our sons need to be educated well, Jewish, and piously, but not our daughters?
                              Women today play a big role in our family life. 
                              Not only is the Jewry at home, the <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q191498" target="_blank">kashrut</a>, the desecration of Sabbath, amongst other things, dependent on them, because the
                              men are busy making a living to 
                              take care of the household. They are not responsible for the children’s and particularly
                              the daughter’s upbringing, but if their daughters are not educated Jewish, one can
                              imagine them wanting to raise their daughters 
                              again. Still, the pious Jewry should strive to educate their daughters as well as
                              their sons. They have to see that their daughter’s do not leave school which is a
                              legal requirement which no one can withdraw from. 
                              They have to see that their daughter’s do not spend their days reading corrupt novels
                              which turn them bad. They have to see that their daughter’s educate themselves economically,
                              they should know cooking, baking, 
                              sewing, stitching and so on. It is necessary for every Jewish housewife to concern
                              themselves with this matter if they do not want to deal with  some blockhead, if they
                              do not want to be associated with bad company, 
                              and to not be unhappy with themselves and make their parents miserable. If they strive
                              for education and knowledge, they can gather enough Jewish knowledge. They can learn
                              to understand our prayers and our poems, 
                              learn a bit of Jewish history, they need to know how much the Jewish people have suffered
                              for their religion and their faith, how many martyrs have devoted themselves, were
                              burnt and drowned for our holy religion. 
                              They therefore should be planted deep in the young hearts, love, and respect for their
                              people, their religion, to their customs, and their performances. At that time, the
                              honest, pious Jew has not been the target 
                              of mockery, at that time they were not looked at like people from past generations,
                              at that time they felt what every pious Jew felt, back then they would know that they
                              are
                              </p>

                           <p>
                              Jewish daughters, that they have Jewish duties. At that time, the old, magnificent
                              Jewish family life could develop and it will be as it was written in the scripture:
                              May peace dwell in your community and tranquillity 
                              in your homes!
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              But this kind of education will also be beneficial in a relationship. It is well-known
                              how hard it is these days for Jews to make a living. The Jewish daughters, as they
                              are being brought up nowadays, do not want to 
                              be involved in any of this. They have to go with the latest fashion. They ruin their
                              parents as girls and the men as women. However, if they are being educated economically
                              and piously, then they will understand how 
                              hard it is to earn money, then they will try to help out their parents if they are
                              struggling and if the parents do not need their help, then at least they will not
                              be their burden and ruin anything by being prodigal.
                              </p> 
                           
                           <p>
                              As I said, it is not easy to provide any specific proposal for the education of the
                              Jewish daughters. The main thing is that the parents will start to care more about
                              their daughters, they should strive to teach them 
                              Jewish and economically. This then will result in great advantages for the Jewry and
                              the capital of parents and men alike.

                              (A letter to the editor.)
                              </h2>
                           
                           <p>
                              As I saw your new newspaper “The Genuine Jew” for the first time, I was so delighted
                              that I felt like I had taken a holiday. It is quite something, indeed will a “genuine
                              Jew” tell the truth. Unfortunately, these times 
                              are filled with lies and the truth hides in the corner, it is afraid to show itself.
                              Therefore, as you are not afraid to tell the truth, I will make time to talk about
                              the passion of your newspaper. I also want to show 
                              our dearest audience the truth a little bit, really show our honest Jews who are not
                              ashamed of reading an honest and truthfully written paper and want to draw your attention
                              to the cancer which is sucking the Jew dry. 
                              And no one wants to budge from what is causing it: the bitter word: <em>the luxury</em>. It is very easily said, one needs to shout it so loudly so that it will be heard
                              at the end of the world 
                              (from one corner of the world to the other), however that only makes the Jew unhappy
                              and hated by our Christian neighbours.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              <em>The luxury</em>, not only ruins our material situation, but also elicits a type of envy among Christians.
                              They really think that every Jewish person possesses great wealth and where should
                              he have gotten 
                              that fortune if not from the Christians themselves. How? Surely not in an honest manner.
                              The Christian also knows that Jews do not earn no fifty percent from any kind of merchandise.
                              No doubt, the Jew is a swindler, a con 
                              man which the Christian cannot find out about. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Let’s look at the truth, apart from the big, rich man making around a thousand guilder
                              or only five hundred a piece. No matter how many pieces of clothes he is making, it
                              needs to be made of velvet, a fashionable piece, 
                              another vogue one, two or three hats, a golden chain.  Even though a whole crowd has
                              gathered for a marriage, already sitting in carved benches ooking at each other in, questioning: have already earned enough for 
                              <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q102477" target="_blank">Sabbath</a>? But all those trifles have to exist. This is as if a law given to <a href="person065" target="_blank">Moses</a> from <a href="place158" target="_blank">Sinai</a>
                              - an unchangeable rule. One has to go outside exhausted to look who thinks they know
                              what is going on. How do the Christians expect that the worn out woman for certain
                              has a vast fund of fifty thousand guilds at home. 
                              He is oblivious that if only he would pay attention, he would hear how high poverty
                              soars there… but the Jewish maidservants work scattered across the <a href="place101" target="_blank">Rhineland</a>. 
                              Are they making serious business with that? They are making a fool out of themselves
                              again and again while poverty keeps growing. And deprives us of our livelihood, this
                              is our misfortune. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Once we manage to look away from what makes hate, will the luxury bring misery from
                              another time. The <em>taxes</em> are measured based on our clothes and hat. The tax inspector understands that if
                              one 
                              earns a lot, one can buy their wife a nice hat and make a beautiful dress. One fact
                              I’d like to highlight which is truly sad, but very true. Not long ago, the tax-inspector
                              went to a bigger city in <a href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a> 
                              with his wife to buy her a hat and went inside a shop. We Jewish people understand
                              that the tax-inspector is a great nobleman. The salesclerk showed them an expensive
                              hat, but they said: they want a very cheap hat. 
                              Truly, they bought a hat for a few guilds. Meanwhile a Jewish woman also entered to
                              buy herself a hat. First they showed her cheap hats, but she was not okay with any
                              cheap hats. Finally they showed her a hat for 25 
                              guilds. Only this one finally pleased her, she did not negotiate long and soon left
                              with the hat in her possession and went home with her bargain… The tax inspector watched
                              this happen and inquired who that woman was. 
                              Once he comes to collect her taxes from the woman with the beautiful hat, he will
                              calculate her taxes based on 50 guilds. The eyes of the shopkeeper darkened once he
                              heard that. He ran up to the tax collector and wanted 
                              to yell. He swears by his bones that he is incapable of paying taxes of that amount,
                              he was not helped by the woman buying a hat for some 20 guilds if he has to pay massive
                              taxes as well. This case alone already shows 
                              what consequences luxury has for us. In another article I want to make an effort to
                              prove with numbers how far luxury pushes the Jew into poverty and how the situation
                              can be improved without luxury.

                           <p>
                              In a recently published book about the circumstances of the squires in East <a href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a> I noticed several interesting bits of information about the Jewish involvement 
                              in estate ownership as owners of tenants as well as owners and tenants of brandy distilleries.
                              
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The book’s author, a Ruthenian, mainly addresses 15 East Galician districts where
                              mainly Ruthenians live. He proves that of the 477 farms situated in these districts,
                              42 % of these are owned
                               
                              </p>
                           
                           <p align="center">- 5 -</p>
                           
                           <p>
                              by tenants. This means 
                              the owners do not maintain the farms on their own, but leased the harvest to a third
                              person. In the districts of <a href="place160" target="_blank">Podolia</a>, 57 % are owned by tenants, in the 
                              <a href="place161" target="_blank">Złotów</a> district 36 %, in the <a href="place150" target="_blank">Husiatyn</a> district 33 %, in the <a href="place162" target="_blank">Zalishchyky</a> 
                              district 80 %, in <a href="place163" target="_blank">Kosiv</a> district 71 %, in the <a href="place164" target="_blank">Kamianka-Buzka</a> district 62 %, in the <a href="place165" target="_blank">Budaniv</a> 
                              district 86 %, in the <a href="place166" target="_blank">Mykulyntsi</a> district 81 %, and so on. Those tenants are mainly Jewish, around 69 %. The writer
                              thinks the reason for this is that Jews pay more 
                              rent than Christians. For example, in the <a href="place166" target="_blank">Mykulyntsi</a> district, Jewish tenants pay 24 crowns for a yoke of land while Christian ones only
                              pay 22. In the 
                              <a href="place167" target="_blank">Pidhaitsi</a> district Jews pay 21 crowns for a yoke while Christians pay 17, in <a href="place165" target="_blank">Budaniv</a> the Jews pay 24, 
                              Christians 19, in the <a href="place163" target="_blank">Kosiv</a> district, the Jews 20, the Christians 13, in <a href="place168" target="_blank">Przemyśl</a> the Jews 22, the 
                              Christians only 9. The Christian tenants of the archbishop’s lands which are not to
                              be rented out to a Jew, do not fear Jewish competition. Therefore, they only pay crowns
                              for a yoke. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              So, 69 % of the tenants are Jewish while there are far less Jewish landlords. From
                              161 landlords in the aforementioned districts, only 24 are Jewish, or 21 %. Most Jewish
                              landlords, 26 % are in the 
                              <a href="place168" target="_blank">Przemyśl</a> district, the least Jewish are found in <a href="place160" target="_blank">Podolia</a>, 12 %. It’s exactly the opposite for the tenants: 
                              most of them live in <a href="place160" target="_blank">Podolia</a>. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              If we add up landlords and tenants as one category, 159 out of 343 are Jewish, or
                              46 % - in the <a href="place169" target="_blank">Berezhany</a> district 40 %, in the <a href="place168" target="_blank">Przemyśl</a>
                              district 41 %, and in <a href="place160" target="_blank">Podolia</a> 58 %.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              However, there are two districts where the percentage of Jews is even bigger in the
                              farming industry. Namely in the <a href="place162" target="_blank">Zalishchyky</a> district with 80 % and in the 
                              <a href="place167" target="_blank">Pidhaitsi</a> district 61 %. Furthermore there are 53 % in the <a href="place170" target="_blank">Zboriv</a>, <a href="place150" target="_blank">Husiatyn</a>,
                              and the <a href="place132" target="_blank">Brody</a> district, 50 % in <a href="place165" target="_blank">Budaniv</a> and <a href="place166" target="_blank">Mykulyntsi</a>, 
                              44 % in the <a href="place171" target="_blank">Skalat</a> district, and in the <a href="place172" target="_blank">Horodok</a>, <a href="place173" target="_blank">Busk</a>, 
                              <a href="place168" target="_blank">Przemyśl</a>, <a href="place164" target="_blank">Kamianka-Buzka</a>, <a href="place163" target="_blank">Kosiv</a> as well as

                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              These have 76 % of all farms of the <a href="place162" target="_blank">Zalishchyky</a> district in their possession, 57 % of the farms in the <a href="place167" target="_blank">Pidhaitsi</a> 
                              district, 50 % of <a href="place170" target="_blank">Zboriv</a>, 41 - 46 % of <a href="place171" target="_blank">Skalat</a>, <a href="place166" target="_blank">Mykulyntsi</a>,

                              district, and 16 % in the <a href="place173" target="_blank">Busk</a> district.

                           <p>
                              In four districts, there are only Jewish tenants but not a single landlord. Namely
                              in the districts of <a href="place166" target="_blank">Mykulyntsi</a>, <a href="place165" target="_blank">Budaniv</a>,
                              <a href="place164" target="_blank">Kamianka-Buzka</a>, and <a href="place172" target="_blank">Horodok</a>. The biggest number of Jewish landlords, 28 %, are to be found in the 
                              <a href="place171" target="_blank">Skalat</a> district. This district is the only one where a Jewish landlord possessed over 5000
                              yoke of farmland. In the <a href="place170" target="_blank">Zboriv</a>

                              If we add up all goods which are owned by Jews and the goods which Jews have leased,
                              then Jewish people have  63 % in the <a href="place162" target="_blank">Zalishchyky</a> district, in

                              These are the numbers we get if woods are included in the goods. However, if we only
                              count the fields in the farming business, one finds that Jews use an even bigger percentage
                              of the land. Namely, 
                              in in the <a href="place162" target="_blank">Zalishchyky</a> district 87 %, in the <a href="place165" target="_blank">Budaniv</a> district 59 %, in the

                              <a href="place174" target="_blank">Vinnytsia</a>, <a href="place168" target="_blank">Przemyśl</a>, <a href="place164" target="_blank">Kamianka-Buzka</a>,

                           <p>
                              Finally, it is important to mention that most of the brandy distilleries are in Jewish
                              ownership. Therefore, in <a href="place169" target="_blank">Berezhany</a> 56 % of all 
                              distilleries belong to Jews, in the <a href="place160" target="_blank">Podolia</a> districts 64 %, in the <a href="place161" target="_blank">Złotów</a> district 92 %, and in 
                              <a href="place163" target="_blank">Kosiv</a> 100 %. This means that all six distilleries in the district are run by Jews.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              According to these statistics, one might believe that the Jews in East <a href="place006" target="_blank">Galicia</a> are very rich and everyone is well off. In reality, poverty is dire and only a very
                              small part is wealthy.

                              Lately, rarely any news of the Russo-Japanese war has been reported. As the first
                              Japanese victories at sea have destroyed the Russian force, the Japanese now control
                              the marines and can do whatever 
                              they want there. <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> has almost completely withdrawn, the main military quarters in the harbour city of
                              <a href="person083" target="_blank">Port Arthur</a>
                              - which the Japanese have besieged - have been dissolved and moved it to the city
                              of <a href="place175" target="_blank"><em>Harbin</em></a> which is several kilometres away 
                              from the sea. Now, the Japanese sent their military to <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> - but until a bigger army is formed there and until they come in contact with the
                              
                              Russians again, meaning the first battle on land, it will still take some time. News
                              from the East-Asian battlefield is therefore not particularly interesting.

                              However, the world’s interest shifts to other nooks. There might be a war breaking
                              out between <a href="place112" target="_blank">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a>, 
                              in which <a href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a> would be involved. Some even say that <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> has already given the order to
                              mobilise the military. Officially it is still denied. But it is known that it has
                              to be denied officially as to keep it a secret - it can still be the truth. - <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>
                              will certainly not be happy that <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> is intervening without their approval and will occupy Macedonia. It

                              has however drawn heavily on its ressources because of the war with <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> and cannot be bothered with it. But it has been said that 
                              <a href="place040" target="_blank">Italy</a> will join forces with <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> in that case and go against <a href="place001" target="_blank">Austria-Hungary</a>. 
                              In this case we would also have an <em>Austrian-Italian</em> war as well. <a href="place010" target="_blank">Germany</a> also does not want to watch from afar but 
                              wants to help <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>, only watching for the right opportunity. Also the French people are starting to
                              get worked up and demand that 
                              <a href="place045" target="_blank">France</a> should prepare for war in case <a href="place011" target="_blank">England</a> and America are planning to support

                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> in turn threatens that if <a href="place011" target="_blank">England</a> will not stop supporting

                              <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a> is determined to not sit still anymore if <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> 
                              is to occupy <a href="place081" target="_blank">Macedonia</a>. Unlike when <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> took 
                              <a href="place142" target="_blank">Bosnia</a>, <a href="place075" target="_blank">Turkey</a> also gathered its military on the

                              cross the borders to defend itself.

                              The latest news of the battlefield concern mostly the movements of both militaries.
                              The Russians try with all their might to bring as much as possible of their military
                              
                              to the battlefield in <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a>. Admittedly, <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> is alone as it 
                              does not have any military, weapons, or rations in Manchuria. <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> has announced that it will still take time until 
                              a battle would start. For the time being, <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> has moved its main quarters from the port city of <a href="place083" target="_blank">Port Arthur</a> 
                              deep into the land into the city of <a href="place175" target="_blank"><em>Harbin</em></a>. The Russians avoid any confrontations with the 
                              Japanese and apply the same tactics as in the war against <a href="person066" target="_blank">Napoleon</a> in 1812. They lured him deep into the country 
                              before destroying all military connections and attacking him. Whether it will be a
                              success, remains a big question. Today’s connections are different than 100 years ago. 
                              Back then it was happening far away from its own country, <a href="place139" target="_blank">Prussia</a> and <a href="place025" target="_blank">Austria</a> 
                              helped <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>, and it was a harsh winter as well. All these things contributed to <a href="person066" target="_blank">Napoleon</a>'s 
                              defeat. - Now we’re moving towards summer and <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> is certainly closer to its own country, it won’t let 
                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> cut the connection so easily. And after all, <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> 
                              is only interested in exiling <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> from <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> and 
                              <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a>. If this goal is reached, <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> will settle down 
                              in both countries and will not strive to chase <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> further. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether 
                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>’s plans will succeed.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              The fact is that <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> admitting that it is not prepared for the war reveals the whole organisation 
                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> functions as. For months now, the whole world has known that a war will break out
                              - 
                              <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> did not know that and did not prepare for war. Whether it is possible to make up
                              for it 
                              remains a big question. <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> strives to sever connections and has already managed to break the 
                              Manchuarian train tracks in several places. If the train system is damaged badly,
                              sending military troops to <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a> 
                              won’t be an easy task.

                              Currently, it seems the sky is also at war with <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>; a quote seems to come true: "Also from the 
                              heavens the stars fought from their courses". - The train with which <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> is sending its military to 
                              <a href="place136" target="_blank">East Asia</a> is breached by <a href="place176" target="_blank">Lake Baikal</a> with a width 
                              of 40 verst [0.66 mile or 1.06 km]. In the winter, the lake is frozen solid and can
                              hold heavy loads. <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> 
                              built tracks on the ice and let the train run over the lake. When heavy winds arose,
                              the ice dispersed which caused people, carts, and goods to tumble 
                              into the waters without a chance of saving them.

                              A second similar misfortune happened to <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>. A Russian ship wanted to lay mines into the water in 
                              order for Japanese ships to trigger them and be destroyed when they wanted to reach
                              the shore. Meanwhile a mine exploded while the preparations were 
                              happening and destroyed <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>’s own ship.
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> will certainly also have to alter their plans because of <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>’s 
                              new tactics. It has to send their military through other ways into <a href="place028" target="_blank">Manchuria</a>. The movements of the 
                              Japanese military are held in secrecy and nobody knows where <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> wants to depose their military. 
                              Preliminarily, it cannot be said for certain when the first battle on land will take
                              place.

                              For now, the Japanese control the sea, they block the harbour of <a href="person083" target="_blank">Port Arthur</a> and bomb the fortress there. 
                              They have already tried a few times to conquer the city, but so far they have not
                              managed to do so. One time, they even lost four ships. But this does not stop 
                              them from pursuing their plans further. <a href="person083" target="_blank">Port Arthur</a> is a strong fortress and if it falls in Japanese hands, 
                              they will have a great advantage.

                              According to some news, <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> allowed Cossacks to enter <a href="place022" target="_blank">Korea</a> 
                              which rode through the land to take some Japanese captive if they crossed their paths.

                              The Russian battleships in <a href="place082" target="_blank">Vladivostok</a> still remain in the harbour and are afraid to venture out as the Japanese 
                              battleships are stationed close to the harbour.

                              A prove how negligent the Russian military is might be this fact: while the Japanese
                              battleship fired at <a href="place83" target="_blank">Port Arthur</a>, 
                              destroying several ships, the Russian marine officers were visiting the circus and
                              were entertained.

                              <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a>’s stance is not certain yet. <a href="place008" target="_blank">America</a> asked all forces to 
                              guarantee <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a>’s neutrality. This means that both countries in this war should not penetrate the
                              Chinese border. 
                              Every country agreed with this proposal, even <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> - only <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> hesitates giving an answer.

                              The Chinese government proclaimed to intervene in war if anybody crosses the border
                              or if the Chinese royal tombs in the city of <a href="place177" target="_blank">Mukden</a> 
                              should be defiled. <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a> would probably join <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a>’s forces. <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> 
                              demanded to lend military forces from <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a>, which should keep guard of the Manchurian trains. <a href="place021" target="_blank">China</a> 
                              answered that <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a> has not trusted the Chinese military in times of peace and should not start believing
                              in it now in times of 
                              war. - Meanwhile the Chinese military is working with <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> and helps destroy the railroads.

                              and gave order to the minister of war, <a href="person068" target="_blank">Kuropatktin</a>. The military force has already been dispatched to <a href="place178" target="_blank">Siberia</a>.

                              First, the senate passed a law that baptised Jews should be noted as former Jews in
                              their passports as well as add their former Jewish name. Because of this they can

                              gain the right by baptism.

                              52 provinces. 1,127,268 Jews (may their number increase) live in the <a href="place094" target="_blank">United States of America</a>. Most of them live in <a href="place096" target="_blank">New York</a>,

                           <p>
                              As we have already reported, the Russian government convened a conference of all provinces
                              to discuss the Jewish question in <a href="place014" target="_blank">Russia</a>. They discussed whether Jewish laws should 
                              be alleviated. The conference is now over and they agreed on the following resolutions:
                              
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              1) The law, disallowing Jews not to live 50 verst away from the border is to be alleviated
                              <em>immediately</em>. The law was passed to break off smuggles of uncostumed 
                              merchandise, as was argued. But it is evident now that the smuggling got worse from
                              that point on. The government also sent telegrams to all provinces ordering to announce
                              that Jews 
                              can live along the borders again. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              2) The laws not allowing Jews to live in villages are to be repealed. The provinces
                              where Jews are allowed to live, should also be allowed to live in villages, but they
                              are not allowed 
                              to purchase land. 
                              </p>
                           
                           <p>
                              Some might argue that the Russian government wants to start treating Jewish people
                              better, but that is not true. At the same time, the Russian government commanded to
                              cast out all Jews 
                              living in <a href="place178" target="_blank">Siberia</a>. The government is probably afraid that Jewish people will ally with <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a> 
                              in the current war with <a href="place019" target="_blank">Japan</a>. And because the military transport is sent with the Siberian railroad Jews are getting
                              expelled. The 
                              whole world was shocked by this current act of violence. Jewish people in <a href="place156" target="_blank">London</a> are demonstrating heavily and want to hand over a 
                              protest via the English government.
